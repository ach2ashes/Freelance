Concept:

The sentiment analysis application is designed to analyze customer reviews and classify them based on their emotional state/valence. The application will be able to handle effects such as negative,neutral and positive. The application consists of four main components: data collection, data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and validation. The components interact with each other to produce accurate and reliable results.

Data Collection:
The first component of the application is data collection. In this phase, customer reviews will be collected from a dataset found on kaggle: marketplace, customer_id, review_id, product_id, product_parent, product_title, product_category, star_rating, helpful_votes, total_votes, vine, verified_purchase, review_headline, review_body, and review_date. This dataset will be used for training the NLP models.

Data Preprocessing:
The second component of the application is data preprocessing. In this phase, the raw text data will be cleaned and preprocessed to make it ready for the sentiment analysis process. The preprocessing steps include removing stop words, removing punctuation marks, converting text to lowercase, lemmatizing, and stemming.

Sentiment Analysis:
The third component of the application is sentiment analysis. In this phase, the preprocessed text data will be analyzed to classify it into three different emotional states/valence, i.e., positive, neutral, or negative. The sentiment analysis process will use machine learning algorithm: Random Forrest to classify the text data. 

Validation:
The fourth component of the application is validation. In this phase, the accuracy of the sentiment analysis results will be validated. The validation process will compare the sentiment analysis results with the ground truth labels of the dataset to determine the accuracy of the sentiment analysis process.
