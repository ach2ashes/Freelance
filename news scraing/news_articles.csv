India’s Unified Payments Interface — better known as UPI — and Singapore’s PayNow were officially connected on Tuesday, allow for a “real-time payment linkage”. The virtual launch was led by a phone call between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien Loong.

“Today is a special day for India-Singapore friendship and for our efforts to deepen collaboration in FinTech and innovaton. The participation of my friend PM Lee Sien Loong made this morning’s programme even more special,” Mr. Modi said. The linkage is set to ease financial transactions for the Indian diaspora.

Singapore has now became the first country with which cross-border Person to Person (P2P) payment facilities have been launched. “This will help the Indian diaspora in Singapore, especially migrant workers/students and bring the benefits of digitalisation and FINTECH to the common man through instantaneous and low-cost transfer of money from Singapore to India and vice-versa,” said the Ministry of External Affairs. UPI payments through QR codes are already taking place in Singapore, though at a limited number of outlets.

“Delighted to launch the linkage between PayNow and India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with PM Narendra Modi today. Congratulations to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India and all the stakeholders in Singapore and India who have helped make the linkage a reality,” Lee Hsien Loong said at the event.

Demonstrating the link, the Reserve Bank of India’s Governor Shaktikanta Das and the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Managing Director Ravi Menon made live “cross-border transactions” to each other using their mobile handsets."
"India, Singapore link systems for real-time cross-border cash transfers - The Register","India, Singapore link systems for real-time cross-border cash transfers  The Register","Wed, 22 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://consent.google.com/m?continue=https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAyLzIyL3NpbmdhcG9yZV9pbmRpYV91cGlfcGF5bm93X2xpbmsv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL0FNUC8yMDIzLzAyLzIyL3NpbmdhcG9yZV9pbmRpYV91cGlfcGF5bm93X2xpbmsv?oc%3D5&gl=FR&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,The Register,https://www.theregister.com,"India's use of government-created tech to expand its sphere of influence advanced yesterday, when Singapore agreed to link the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to its own PayNow scheme – enabling real-time cross-border payments between the two nations.

UPI is a peer-to-peer or peer-to-merchant scheme that transfers money between bank accounts in real time. PayNow does likewise, using a mobile phone number as the identifier.

Both schemes were designed for use within their source nation's borders.

But yesterday Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong announced interoperability between the schemes, meaning residents in either country can make cross-border payments in real time – provided they hold accounts with participating banks.

News of the two schemes intertwining is about more than just convenience, or the boost to the nations' digital economies both leaderss enthused about at the launch.

The announcement is also a demonstration of India using government-developed software to extend its regional influence.

India created UPI to meet a domestic need for faster payments – and to bring more people out of the cash economy and within reach of tax authorities.

UPI operates at enormous scale – the scheme processed over eight billion transactions in January 2023 alone.

UPI is also an expression of India's belief in digital public goods – software that performs a useful function that India needs, and operates at sufficient scale that it represents a counterweight to commercial services that might otherwise dominate markets.

Open source software fills a similar role in other fields. Big software companies put energy into Linux to ensure commercial operating systems face robust competition so the likes of Microsoft can't accrue too much influence.

In July 2022 India bundled several of its digital public goods into a project called IndiaStack, which it offered to other governments free of charge.

IndiaStack is about building influence, according to Baani Grewal, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute where she leads strategic engagement with South Asia and focuses on India.

""The Indian government wants to export a governance model that is separate from China, the EU, and the United States,"" she told The Register.

""And it helps India to have South Asian countries be part of its payment system, or to show that Europe or Australia are adopting India's digital models.""

Adoption of UPI abroad also plays well at home, Grewal said, as Indian travellers perceive their government having achieved widespread influence.

Other travellers can also get a taste of UPI. The scheme has previously required participants to hold a bank account in India, but early in February India's Reserve Bank announced that eligible visitors from G20 countries will be allowed to create ""Prepaid Payment Instruments"" – wallets linked to UPI for making payments at Indian merchants that accept the scheme.

The choice of G20 nations is no accident: India is the current chair of the bloc and will host many meetings, and many thousands of influential visitors, during the year. Many may go home with a positive UPI story to share.

The Singapore/India UPI deal may also mean that the Indian scheme's brand starts to appear at points of sale – just like Alibaba's AliPay has done around the world.

Singapore's status as a regional financial service hub will also give UPI a fine shop window.

Perhaps the bilateral deal may also make life a little harder for another cross-border payments contender: blockchain. After all, who needs to go through all the pain of building new payment systems, and reassuring users there's no taint from cryptocurrency and other fintech flops, when governments already have the systems to make cross-border money movements happen? ®"

“Many experts are estimating that digital wallet transactions are going to soon overtake cash transactions,” PM Modi added.

India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing ecosystems for fintech innovation. Prime Minister Modi’s visionary leadership has been instrumental in driving globalisation of India’s best-in-class digital payment infrastructure, union finance ministry said in a statement.

“A key emphasis of the Prime Minister has been on ensuring that the benefits of UPI are not limited to India only, but other countries too benefit from it,” it said.

The linkage of these two payment systems would enable residents of both countries in faster and cost-efficient transfer of cross-border remittances, it added, also helping the Indian diaspora in Singapore, especially migrant workers and students through instantaneous and low cost transfer of money from Singapore to India and vice-versa.

Major Driver - Instant and smooth money transfer process

Instant and smooth money transfer process drives the growth of the UPI market in India. The UPI is based on the IMPS platform, in which, users have the flexibility to make the payment at any time and from anywhere.

Significant Trends - The growing emergence of mobile apps for shopping transactions

The growing emergence of mobile apps for shopping transactions is an emerging UPI market trend in India. When compared to websites, online shopping transactions are higher in mobile apps because of the increasing penetration of smart devices in the market. Furthermore, market vendors such as Google LLC, Paytm Payments Bank Limited, and Walmart Inc. offer mobile-based UPI apps. Some examples of UPI apps include GooglePay, PayTM, and PhonePe. Hence, trends like the growing emergence of mobile apps for shopping transactions are expected to drive the growth of the UPI market in India during the forecast period.

Key Challenges - UPI payment frauds

The UPI payment frauds challenge the growth of the UPI market in India. Misleading UPI handles, request money fraud, and phishing are some of the examples of UPI payment frauds that take place in the market.

For instance, in phishing, fraudsters send unauthorized links via emails or SMSs to the users, and once they click on such unauthorized links, the money gets transferred from their account to the fraudster's account. Hence, challenges such as fraud happening in the market can hamper the growth of the UPI market in India during the forecast period.

MUMBAI, April 6 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is proposing expanding the reach of the popular Unified Payments Interface (UPI) digital payments system by allowing credit to be offered via pre-approved bank lines.

UPI is an instant real-time payments system that allows users to transfer money across multiple banks without disclosing bank account details.

""UPI, which currently involves transactions between deposit accounts or wallets, will now expand further to credit lines given by banks,"" RBI deputy governor Rabi Sankar said at a press conference after the central bank's monetary policy decision.

The move could potentially reduce the number of cards held by a customer, Sankar added.

UPI's popularity is seen to have reduced the usage of cash and debit cards for daily transactions.

It recorded 8.65 billion transactions in March, amounting to 14.05 trillion rupees, its highest-ever since inception, data from the National Payments Corporation of India showed.

""The RBI's latest move is likely to increase the use case for UPI and allow banks to experiment with products and reduce the cost of offerings,"" said a senior banker at a large state-run bank.

It will be a ""huge disruptor"" for both the credit card market and the buy-now-pay-later segment, the banker added. They did not wish to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

In a bid to boost digital payments, the RBI recently allowed RuPay credit cards to be linked to UPI. This was to enable customers to link their credit cards and pay via UPI.

However, this did not ""move the needle"" for private sector banks, as most credit cards they issued were on the Visa and Mastercard settlement systems, said Shivaji Thapliyal, head of research and lead analyst at YES Securities.

With pre-sanctioned credit lines now proposed, private sector banks can now simply offer credit card-like products to anyone who has a UPI relationship with the bank, Thapliyal added.

The skepticism was regarding if UPI payments will now be charged or continue to remain free.

Clearing the air about the recently introduced interchange charges, NPCI said that bank to bank account transfer via UPI will continue to remain free.

This means that regular UPI transactions, the ones that are made directly from bank account to bank account, will remain free. There are three ways to transfer money via UPI -- by entering the virtual payment address (VPA) of the receiver, account number and IFSC code or QR code.

So, what will change from 1 April?

From 1 April, 2023, an extra interchange fee of 1.1 per cent will be charged on merchant (the person or business receiving the payment) UPI transactions of over ₹2,000 using prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) – wallets or cards.

An interchange fee is the fee charged by the receiver bank/payment service provider to the merchant.

In simple words, the charge will apply if a customer has a wallet of one particular company and makes a payment to a merchant, who has a wallet of another company.

However, there are no charges for normal customer transactions or for bank account-to-bank account-based UPI payments.

What are the charges?

The interchange fee varies for the different categories of merchants. It starts from 0.5 per cent to 1.1 per cent and a cap is also applicable in certain categories.

For telecom, education, and utilities/post office, the interchange fee is 0.7 per cent while for supermarkets the fee is 0.9 per cent of the transaction value. About 1 per cent charges will be levied for insurance, government, mutual funds and railways, 0.5 per cent for fuel, and 0.7 per cent for agriculture.

""Interchange charges are only applicable for the PPI merchant transactions and there is no charge to customers,"" NPCI said in a statement.

This levy was being introduced to help cover for the cost of interchange or interoperable between two wallets.

NPCI has permitted the PPI wallets to be part of interoperable UPI ecosystem and levied 1.1 per cent charge on UPI transactions above ₹2,000 while using PPI.

Which transactions will not attract interchange fees, then?

NPCI said the interchange fee will not be applicable on P2P or peer-to-peer transactions and P2PM or peer-to-peer-merchant transactions between a bank account and a PPI wallet.

Essentially, this charge will only apply to digital wallet transactions made via merchant QR codes.

This means that all payments made using UPI such as Paytm, Phonepe, Google Pay to friends, family or to a merchant’s bank account will not be affected by this interchange fee.

So, who will pay these charges?

The fee of 1.1 per cent will not be charged on UPI payments, but only on payments of ₹2,000 or higher made from digital wallets to UPI IDs.

For instance, if a customer tries to make a PPI payment via UPI (Paytm/Google Pay) at a store or online, and the QR code is that of PhonePe, then PhonePe will receive the applicable interchange fee from the merchant.

The fee will be levied on the merchant side. Therefore, merchants may or may not choose to pass on the extra fee to consumers.

What is PPI?

Prepaid payment instruments include mobile/payment wallets (such as Paytm Wallet, Amazon Pay Wallet, PhonePe Wallet), smart cards, stripe cards, paper vouchers, etc. With the use of of PPIs, a person can send and receive money without any physical exchange of cash or card.

""The guidelines make wallets more appealing to customers by opening up newer use cases of payments. It will eliminate the need for customers to carry multiple cards, thereby reducing fraud and theft due to the exposure of card numbers,"" said Akash Sinha, Co-founder & CEO, of Cashfree Payments.

Current UPI transactions charges

At present, there are no charges levied on transactions done via UPI. The government had mandated a zero-charge framework for UPI transactions till now. This means that charges in UPI were nil for users and merchants alike.

More data

Share of individual to merchants transactions above ₹2,000 is about 5 per cent of the total transactions last month.

In recent times, UPI has emerged as the preferred mode of digital payment by offering free, fast, secure and seamless experience.

Traditionally, the most preferred method of UPI transactions is linking the bank account in any UPI-enabled app for making payments, which contribute over 99.9 per cent of total UPI transactions.

The volume of UPI transactions has increased manifold from 0.45 crore in January 2017 to 804 crore in January this year. The value of UPI transactions has increased from just ₹1,700 crore to ₹12.98 lakh crore during the same period.

MUMBAI, India, March 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- With Cash use declining from 71 percent of POS transaction value in 2019 to just 27 percent in 2022, India has emerged as a global leader in payments with the development of its next-generation real-time payments (RTP) infrastructure, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), helping E-commerce account-to-account (A2A) payments grow to US$12 billion, up 53 percent from 2021 to 2022 and digital wallets growth from 5 percent to 35 percent of POS value, according to a new report released today from global financial technology leader FIS ® (NYSE: FIS).

The Worldpay from FIS Global Payments Report 2023 examines how consumers pay today both in-store and online across 40 global markets. Findings from the 2023 report show that in 2022, there were almost 70 real-time payment schemes providing high-speed payment rails that drove A2A payments to account for US$525 billion in global e-commerce transaction value, up 13 percent from US$463 billion in 2021.

India's developed United Payment Interface (UPI) has almost become the default payment option. While cash is still there, increasingly a majority of peer to peer transaction are done through UPI. According to the data released by FIS, cash is expected to decline by 34% in transaction value by 2026 and digital wallets are expected to rise in transaction value by 88% by 2026. In the online space, the e-commerce market size is expected to grow by 82% by 2026 providing a greater boost to digital payments.

UPI has become India's leading digital payments platform, growing at a huge 427 percent in transaction volume between March 2020 and August 2022[2], helping A2A payments grow to US$12 billion, up 53 percent from 2021 to 2022. Its seamless interoperability with commercial wallets such as Google Pay, Paytm and PhonePe, has helped digital wallets grow from 5 percent POS market share in 2019 to 35 percent in 2022. UPI's volume is continuing to show tremendous growth, increasing from 2.2 billion transactions in December 2020, to 4.5 billion in December 2021, and to 7.8 billion in December 2022. As of January 2023, the number of banks live on UPI has increased to 385[3] and this number is expected to rise in the upcoming years. Further analysis in the Global Payments Report also shows that by 2026, A2A transaction value is expected to grow by 195 percent to US$36 billion.

Phil Pomford, General Manager APAC, Worldpay Merchant Solutions at FIS, said: ""The success of UPI in India is changing consumers payment preferences faster than anyone could have predicted. UPI gives consumers the ability to transfer funds easily and instantly, 24/7, free of charge, from one bank account to another, and its success shows consumers want more choice, convenience and control at the checkout. It is driving consumers away from cash and helping to drive financial inclusion all at the same time and is making India a leader in payments across not just the region, but the globe. The development of real-time payment schemes by other central banks – and, critically, the cooperation between those central banks – is also helping to fuel cross-border commerce, providing merchants with a significant opportunity for growth moving forward.""

India Payment Trends:

Account-to-account (A2A) payments are projected to increase their share in e-commerce payment methods from 15 percent in 2022 to 24 percent in 2026.

Cash was dominant just a few years ago, accounting for 71 percent of POS transaction value in 2019, but by 2022, cash had dropped to represent just 27 percent of POS value.

Cash is projected to decline even further by 2026, projecting to account for just 14 percent of POS market share.

In 2022, digital wallets accounted for 50 percent of e-commerce transaction value and 35 percent of POS transaction value in India.

This push comes after Ritesh Shukla, International CEO of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which developed UPI, stated that the number of countries where UPI is live will double in the next 12-18 months.

“There are many countries in the world which have similar problems we had before the advent of UPI. These are financial inclusion, supporting rural economies, fintech incubation, transparency and other things. We are looking at partnering with those countries to help them create their own versions of UPI in a very sovereign manner,"" he told Mint earlier in August.

In recent years, India has marketed its signature UPI platform to a number of developing countries. India follows two strategies to boost UPI’s global footprint. The first is to help build platforms and digital infrastructure for partner nations. The second is to sign commercial partnerships and linkages with existing platforms in foreign countries to make life easier for Indian travelers and migrants.

“We have about 30 million Indians who live outside India. They send about $100 billion every year. Today, this experience is very, very fragmented, depending on which part of the world you live in. We are trying to see how we can standardize this whole user-experience,"" Shukla said

The push comes as part of an effort to project the country as a voice for the interests of developing nations in global forums.

In June, India signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Sierra Leone and Suriname on sharing its DPI solutions. Mint reported earlier that India is also in talks with a number of other developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia, to extend these DPI partnerships.

India’s neighbours have also adopted UPI in recent years. Nepal and Bhutan use the platform while Sri Lanka is expected to operationalise UPI in the coming months. This year, India and Singapore linked their payments systems to allow for an easier flow of remittances.

The numbers are a significant uptick from April when the platform recorded 8.89 billion transactions worth Rs 14.07 trillion.

Data released by the NPCI showed that approximately Rs 3.96 trillion worth of transactions took place in the final 10 days of May.

“Celebrating a milestone moment! We've crossed a phenomenal 9 billion transactions on UPI in the month of May’23, & it's all thanks to you, India! Together, we are shaping the future of payments. Let's continue this journey of growth and innovation!” NPCI tweeted.

According to several estimates, UPI is projected to account for 90 per cent of the digital payments over the next five years.

A recent report by PwC India titled 'The Indian Payments Handbook – 2022-27', has projected that UPI will achieve a groundbreaking milestone of 1 billion daily transactions by 2026-27. In the 2022-23, UPI accounted for 75 per cent of the total transaction volume, signifying a massive shift towards digital payments.

With a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50 per cent, the total number of online transactions is projected to surge from 103 billion in FY 2022-23 to 411 billion in FY 2026-27.

UPI transactions, in particular, are expected to experience a substantial rise from 83.71 billion in 2022-23 to a staggering 379 billion transactions by 2026-27.

UPI's introduction in India

It was in 2016 that NPCI introduced the revolutionary UPI system. PhonePe and PayTM were some of the first platforms to integrate UPI into its system. A year later, several competitors followed the suit and since then, UPI has transformed into a behemoth that even foreign nations are looking to get their hands on.

Singapore and Bhutan have already adopted UPI, with a few more countries waiting to join the bandwagon.

One of the biggest USPs of UPI is its open architecture which allows seamless integration. Users can link their bank accounts directly and initiate transactions effortlessly.

This interoperability eliminated the need for multiple payment apps, making UPI an attractive choice for consumers and businesses.

In a bid to further boost digital payments, India's central bank recently allowed RuPay credit cards to be linked to UPI. This was to enable customers to link their credit cards and pay via UPI.

Taro had earlier spoken to LiveMint in March where he suggested that Japan would be sending a team to India to properly analyse the UPI system. If Japan were to adopt the digital payments platform, discussions would be held on the potential linking of the two countries' systems. The Japanese minister also touched upon bilateral cooperation with respect to telecommunication systems security.

While speaking to Wion, Taro lauded the convenience of the UPI system as it can be utilised for transferring money across countries once it is incorporated by Singapore, Thailand or the UAE that have also expressed interest in adopting it as a standard. “So it could be another standard of tele-payment cross border tele-payment system,"" he added.

In reference to India’s digital identity program, expected to form the foundation for interoperability, he said that the East Asian country was looking at options to mutually recognise the same.

Following the G7 Digital Ministers Meeting held last week, in which India’s telecom and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw was also a participant, the group decided to bring in a new international framework which is a permanent secretariat on cross-border data flow.

Responding to Taro’s statements, Vaishnaw thanked the Japanese digital minister for ‘accepting PM Modi’s deep and extensive vision for Digital India'.

Given that the unified payments interface (UPI) has transformed the digital payment ecosystem in India, RBI said, the addition of new features over time has enabled UPI to facilitate diverse payment needs of the economy. According to RBI, as artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly integrated into the digital economy, conversational instructions hold immense potential in enhancing ease of use, and consequently reach, of the UPI system.

“It is, therefore, proposed to launch an innovative payment mode – ‘conversational payments’ on UPI – that will enable users to engage in a conversation with an AI-powered system to initiate and complete transactions in a safe and secure environment,"" it said.

This channel, RBI said, will be made available in both smartphones and feature phones-based UPI channels and would help deepen digital penetration. The facility will, initially, be available in Hindi and English and will subsequently be made available in more Indian languages, it said.

“Conversational payments can bring about immense possibilities of countless engagement and communication and also paves way for government’s collaboration with up-and-coming tech companies focused around AI,"" said Rahul Tandon, chief product officer, Safexpay, a provider of payment and banking solutions.

RBI also proposed to facilitate offline transactions using Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, which it believes will not only enable retail digital payments in situations where internet or telecom connectivity is weak or unavailable but will also ensure speed. In September last year, RBI launched an on-device wallet called “UPI-Lite"" to optimise processing resources for banks, thereby reducing transaction failures. On Thursday, RBI said the product has gained traction and currently processes more than 10 million transactions a month.

“Support for NFC-based tap-and-pay UPI payments initiation will further improve the ease-of-use of UPI apps for UPI-lite. Acceptance will likely be supported at the merchant end via the merchant's mobile phone or via the merchant's payment terminal,"" said Harish Prasad, head of banking – India at fintech firm FIS.

Meanwhile, RBI proposed to increase the per transaction limit to ₹500 for small value digital payments in the offline mode. The overall limit would be retained at ₹2,000 to contain the risks associated with relaxation of two-factor authentication. RBI said that by removing the need for two-factor authentication for small value transactions, these channels enable faster, reliable, and contactless mode of payments for everyday small value payments, transit payments etc.

“In a broader context, the central bank's concerted efforts to enhance the adoption and effectiveness of digital payments are fostering a robust and competitive environment for all stakeholders involved,"" said Akash Sinha, chief executive and co-founder, Cashfree Payments.

The Reserve Bank Innovation Hub is also developing a digital public tech platform for delivery of frictionless credit. According to RBI, the end-to-end digital platform will have an open architecture, open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and standards, to which all financial sector players can connect seamlessly in a ‘plug and play’ model."

UPI has been a revolution for the entire economy in large part due to rapid adoption by millennials and GenZs. It has accelerated the adoption of digital payments, and made making peer-to-peer payments easier for use cases such as bill splitting and money transfers.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will withdraw ₹2,000 denomination banknotes that were in circulation since 2016. This was announced by the central bank on May 19. The RBI has said banknotes in ₹2,000 denomination will continue to be legal tender. The central bank mentioned several reasons that influenced its decision to withdraw the currency notes.

Citing data from a report titled 'India Digital Payments Annual Report', RBI said UPI and digital payments increased tremendously in the last few years.

According to Satyajeet Kunjeer, Founder, of Deciml, the high adoption of UPI by vendors as well as buyers has definitely added to it becoming a convenient and preferred platform - in a matter of only 7 years. What’s even more interesting, however, is that alongside making spending/transacting easier - UPI has also served to become a central platform that is enabling several other associated financial services such as expense tracking, budgeting, saving, and investing.

As things stand today, it is highly likely that everyone - not just millennials - will come to rely entirely on digital financial services, he added.

E-commerce grew as UPI facilitated hassle-free online payments

UPI has also increased financial awareness by offering access to various financial services and investments, making millennials and GenZs more knowledgeable about their options. “It has streamlined investment transactions, allowing for seamless investments in mutual funds, stocks, and alternative investments such as P2P lending and IPOs. UPI-enabled platforms provided real-time portfolio tracking, simplified SIPs, and lowered investment costs,"" said Neha Juneja, CEO, IndiaP2P.com

Unified Payments Interface (UPI)

UPI offers services from hundreds of banks and mobile payment apps, with no transaction fees. FinTech, banks, and telcos have adopted this platform and have further driven UPI growth through QR code placements at merchant point-of-sale (POS).

According to a PwC report titled “The Indian Payments Handbook – 2022-27"", UPI transactions are likely to reach 1 billion per day by 2026-27, accounting for 90 per cent of the retail digital payments in the country.

The Fed should try to replicate the extraordinary success of India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), writes John Mitchell, of E6. sdx15 - stock.adobe.com

Real-time payments improve cash flow for businesses and individuals, freeing up funds for purchases and investments that can drive wider economic growth. FedNow, the Federal Reserve's new instant payment infrastructure, could then become a welcome catalyst for the U.S. economy.

The Fed's efforts to facilitate real-time payments, however, could fall disappointingly short if it doesn't take some lessons from the world's most widely used real-time digital payments system: India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

Smartphones have changed how people interact with the world, right down to how we buy everyday goods and services. Paying digitally may seem inconsequential, but the reduced frictions it brings to financial processes boosts business productivity and can foster innovation. Adding real-time settlement to that dynamic simply amplifies the economic impact.

We know this because we've already seen the benefits in Asia.

Asia's dynamic economies have been at the leading edge of a rapid convergence between finance and technology. Even before the pandemic, the region outpaced the rest of the world in adopting cashless transactions. From the birth of Alipay and WeChatPay in China to the PromptPay platform in Thailand, BI-Fast in Indonesia or most dramatically with UPI in India, Asia is home to some of the most successful real-time payments projects globally.

Consumers in many Asian markets pay for almost everything digitally with payments that deduct from accounts immediately. Ride hailing, big-box retail, e-commerce, hawker stalls — every vendor displays a QR code to connect with consumers' digital wallets via their smartphones. These real-time payments networks have brought the benefits of financial inclusion to millions of unbanked citizens, and helped countless businesses to become more efficient.

Loans, banking and insurance providers have capitalized on data from payment activity to speed up or automate credit decisions, helping to elevate competition for consumer business among finance providers and others.

The next wave of development will enable cross-platform and cross-border commerce. India has already linked UPI to Singapore's PayNow network, and further expansions that allow other countries and visitors to India to use UPI are on the way.

The U.S. has lagged in implementing real-time digital payments partly due to the success and ubiquity of its credit card networks. There's simply been less need for alternatives. But with e-commerce and innovations like open banking or buy now/pay later (BNPL) continuing to transform the retail landscape, all businesses are looking for ways to improve customer experiences.

Market intelligence firm IDC predicts that nonbank digital payments, like the digital wallets already popular in Asia, will overtake bank payments in the U.S. as soon as 2028.

In that context, UPI may have some lessons for the newly launched FedNow about modernization.

Since UPI's launch more of India's economy has formalized, up to 80% in 2021, according to the State Bank of India, versus less than 50% in 2017. That's contributed to India becoming the fastest-growing economy among the world's five largest. UPI isn't the whole story there, but it's a key pillar.

Aside from increasing convenience for consumers and businesses, an important lesson from UPI is how a mobile-first and interoperable payments system heightens access to financial services by expanding the pool of providers. Greater competition and collaboration between market players, as well as across industries, leads to more choices for consumers and better user experiences.

To replicate that success, FedNow must include clear standards for the integration of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs promote the kind of technical openness and commercial interoperability that ensures healthy competition and collaboration among companies — finance, technology, retail or any kind of business. Apple, once just a computer company, now offers savings accounts; its own digital payment platform is key to enabling that, and FedNow could support more of this kind of industry cross-pollination.

But first, it will need to boost corporate participation in FedNow. UPI is ubiquitous in India and there are government mandates for private firms to support it. FedNow's more free-market approach may ultimately be more beneficial to companies, but the initial list of supporting institutions is only 57 names long, versus some ten thousand financial firms across the county. Driving that buy-in will be critical.

But after 100 billion transactions, the most important lesson UPI may have for FedNow is promoting consumer take-up.

Using UPI is incredibly simple. It is an open framework, so people don't need to use a special app to make or receive payments. It is as simple as cash but with the benefits of digital data.

UPI is compatible with low-tech feature phones as well as advanced smartphones. That brings more users into the pool, especially from older or marginalized populations, who are often left out of technological advances. These financial inclusion benefits may be greater in India's 1.4 billion population than in the well-banked U.S. economy of 350 million, but there is still a wide range of technological as well as financial literacy in the U.S. For FedNow to deliver the economic benefits that India has enjoyed from UPI, it must be accessible to everyone.

Still, UPI is not perfect, and this could be a lesson too. A survey in 2022 found that about 18% of UPI customers have experienced some kind of grievance, such as failed, fraudulent or mistaken transactions. FedNow's incorporation of ISO20022, the latest global standard for financial data interchange, could help overcome these challenges. Its richer data should not only improve security but also offer service providers more ways to implement systems for consumer redress. When companies compete on security and reliability, everybody wins.

For FedNow benefits to reach everyone in the U.S., users will need to understand its availability, capability and what it means for them. Much of UPI's success grew from comprehensive public awareness campaigns and the Fed should likewise invest in educating the full range of U.S. citizens and businesses that will come to depend on its platform.

This isn't just about adding tech to finance; it's about simplifying finance to catalyze growth. UPI has done it. FedNow can too.

Among all the digital payment channels, UPI continues to play a dominant role, the report further shows.

One of the most noteworthy observations of the report is that UPI P2M (peer to merchant) and P2P (peer to peer) are the most preferred payment modes among consumers with a market share of 40 percent and 44 percent in terms of transactions volume, making a total of 84 percent.

The number of UPI transactions in 2022 touched 74 billion transactions, a 70 percent increase in the year. The value of transactions was ₹126 trillion, a 54 percent increase.

P2M accounted for 40 percent in volume and 18 percent in value.

The report further highlights a number of other key observations. For instance, the average ticket size for P2M transactions in December 2022 was ₹687 while P2P transactions was ₹2,753.

The number of POS (points of sale) terminals at the end of 2022 was 7.55 million, signalling a growth of 37% YOY (year-on-year).

Credit and debit cards

The digital payments annual report also highlighted that the total number of credit and debit cards in circulation by end of Year 2022 was 1.02 billion.

Banks have increased the number of credit cards by 18 percent from 69 million in December 2021 to 81.1 million in December 2022, indicating an increased appetite for higher ticket transactions. The volume and value of transactions done on credit cards has seen a steady uptick through the year.

The report further points out that credit card transactions in 2023 could benefit majorly as credit cards are now eligible for doing UPI transactions.

The POS market share is dominated by seven financial institutions. The report suggests that HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, RBL Bank, Paytm Payments Bank, IndusInd Bank cover 92 percent market share as of December 2022.

The number of prepaid payment instruments stood at 16.23 billion by December 2022. Out of these, 13.34 billion were wallets and 288.8 million were cards.

Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday said payments through UPI (unified payment interface) have grown exponentially in the past 12 months with daily transactions crossing 36 crore, which is up 50% from 24 crore in February 2022, according to a PTI report.

While launching the Digital Payments Awareness Week at the RBI headquarters in Mumbai, the governor reportedly said that, in value terms, these transactions are worth INR 6.27 lakh crore, registering a growth of 17% from INR 5.36 lakh crore in February 2022 and added that the overall monthly digital payment transactions crossed over INR 1,000-crore-mark each month during the past three months.

""Our payment systems are talked about globally and several countries have shown interest to replicate our success story. It is a matter of pride that our payment systems have witnessed over 1,000 crore transactions every month since December 2022. This speaks volumes of the robustness of our payments ecosystem and acceptance by consumers. A recent pan-India digital payments survey (covering 90,000 respondents) revealed that 42 per cent of respondents have used digital payments,"" Das said in a statement.

According to the report, In terms of volume, the number of UPI transactions exceeded 800 crore in January 2023, while NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) witnessed the highest ever daily volume of 3.18 crore transactions on February 28.

As per the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), UPI transaction volumes during October 2020 in India had crossed the 2-billion mark which was around 270 million higher than the corresponding figure for September 2020. Gradually, the transactions on the unified payments interface (UPI) recorded the 6 billion mark in July 2022, reported as the highest ever by India's flagship digital payments platform since its inception. As per national payment corporation of India (NPCI), UPI processes 628 crore transactions worth INR 10.63 lakh crore during the month.

The UPI was launched in 2016, and since then it has emerged as the most popular and preferred payment mode pioneering person-to-person and person-to-merchant transactions accounting for 75 per cent of the total digital payments. In a nutshell, volume of UPI transactions has reportedly increased manifold from 0.45 crore in January 2017 to 804 crore in January 2023."

They will be able to link their non-Indian mobile phone numbers, or the mobile number commonly used by them in their countries, to make payments through UPI.

What are the transactions it covers?

All the present use cases of UPI will be available to NRIs who opt to use this facility. It can cover retail as well as wholesale transactions.

How does the process work?

The user should first link the mobile number with an NRO or NRE (non-resident ordinary or non-resident external) account. The member bank whose accounts are being linked by the customer needs to ensure that the required KYC (Know Your Customer) is done as per the governing laws, including the Foreign Exchange Management Act or FEMA.

The onus of compliance will rest with the respective banks and hence procedures laid down by the RBI in this regard should also be complied with. In addition to this, the remitter and beneficiary banks (that is, the bank through which the payment is initiated and the bank which is receiving the payment) need to have the required checks and compliance validations with respect to anti-money laundering (AML) rules.

Also read UPI has given cashless economy a boost

How is the proposed mechanism better than the existing one?

Even now, NRIs can use the UPI app for payments. However, being a sim-linked payments process, they needed an Indian mobile phone number. This meant that to keep the number alive, they had to pay the phone bills or top-up the number, in case it is a pre-paid connection.

By linking the accounts with a non-Indian sim card, the maintenance cost is eliminated. That said, the level of compliance by banks may increase if the user migrates from an Indian mobile number to a foreign number. Even under the existing mechanism, the linkage of the mobile number is with NRO/NRE. With the migration to a foreign number, the FEMA and AML related compliances which the member banks must undertake will increase and that is not the case at present.

Is UPI extended to NRIs across all countries?

No. The first phase of rollout is extended only to ten countries — Singapore, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Oman, Qatar, the US, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the UK.

When does it come into effect?

From April 30, NRIs will be able to use UPI from their non-Indian mobile numbers for payments. NPCI is presently working with its member banks for the back-end integration including the validation processes and linking of phone numbers."

As the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) takes its first steps abroad, Forbes India speaks with Ritesh Shukla, CEO, NPCI International, to understand the future plans. On the anvil are to increase the acceptance of UPI QR codes by merchants abroad so that Indians travelling on business or pleasure can use their Indian UPI apps—BHIM, PhonePe, Paytm, GooglePay—to scan and make payments. The NPCI [National Payments Corporation of India] would also like to enable payments from Indians working abroad who send money back home. And lastly, there are plans to work with other countries to allow them to develop UPI-like domestic payment systems. Edited excerpts:



Related stories Digital payments: The next wave is here

India's maturing fintech ecosystem: Five companies to watch in 2023

RBI's signal to PPI holders: Use licence for only what is mandated Q. When did you first think of going global and how did you go about it?

Before diving into the specific question, it is important to look at the Indian ecosystem—that is where some people have coined this term, digital public infrastructure (DPI). If you look at the DPIs that we have, infrastructure we have developed in India… they stack beautifully—there is the identity layer, the payment layer and the payment exchange layer. So, when it comes to NPCI, we are sitting on the second layer. The role that NPCI and UPI have played has created a lot of excitement globally. The approach we have taken is adding new use cases and acquiring new customers. So, we are growing on both axes and that multiplier effect is creating traction, new flows, and enabling new opportunities for the ecosystem. As an outcome of this approach, there are beautiful things happening. There is financial inclusion. There is better money movement that, if I can say, is leading to better tax compliance and faster economic activity. It is leading to fintechs getting new solutions and platforms, and so, many of them are thriving.



Lot of countries around the world are in a similar space [they have high cash usage] and have an evolved telecom sector and a median age like India’s [India is 28, Africa is 19]. There is lots that they can learn… and create similar ecosystems in their country. There is a lot that has got us excited, including the recognition we have received internationally. All this has given us the confidence to take homegrown solutions and create this outside India. That is the underlying thought behind us going global.



Also read: Every app a UPI app and credit is the next big thing: Anuj Kacker



Q. Is the endeavour to have a payment system out of India to rival the two or three global networks we have? Or is it to have a payment system Indians can use when aboard?

Thank you for this question. It allows me to articulate our strategy. First of all, we are not here to create rivalry.



When we go outside [India], there are two key areas of focus. One is building interoperability with India and that means two things—creating opportunities for travellers from India when they go to international markets, giving them the option to scan their UPI apps and make UPI payments. Today, we are live in four countries, but there is work going on for many countries.



The other use case has to do with Indians living abroad. Today, there are 30 million Indians living abroad—in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and even North America, and they have a need to send money back home. How can we use the core infrastructure we have for UPI to bring that money faster and in a more efficient manner?



The other part that is more long term is helping other countries create UPI-like ecosystems. And our model is that we prefer working with central banks or central bank-authorised entities so that we create a relevant proposition that not only has technology but also business know how. Let’s be honest… UPI is not the first instant payment platform in the world. But the success of UPI lies in the way we conduct our business. You look at how collaborative our model is—how deeply we are working with fintechs, how we are creating new things on top of the basic platform. So, we are working at the frontier of technology and the world knows the value they have delivered in a complex country like India.



Q. Has NPCI given out any data on transactions with QR codes that are scanned abroad or when money comes to India via UPI?

The way things work in payments—we create a lifecycle chart and so while it takes time [initially], it moves like a hockey stick curve later and then it stabilises. That is the usual customer lifecycle. Like you mentioned, we have been in the business for two to three—the reality is that not all systems are designed for one standardised approach. When you are working in such a diverse landscape, you have to create capabilities to not only read the message format coming from the foreign country but also be able to propagate it further within the ecosystem in India. So, we are somewhere in the process of creating a compliant ecosystem and this includes working with banks, fintechs and big techs here in India to be able to support cross border transactions. At NPCI, we may create these connections, but what if the banks’ core systems are not able to read a message format that comes in a currency that is not 356 [356 is the code for Indian rupee]. We are also investing a lot with our partners to be able to train and retrain cashiers etc to offer this to customers as a payment service. So, we are in that process and whatever others have achieved in 70 years of their service, we are working way faster than them. The whole point is about driving transactions. You don’t want to create rails and not see any traffic. In times to come, we will be able to share numbers with you.



Also listen: Your UPI experience is about to change...



Q. You spoke about dealing with central banks. And the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced the digital currency on a pilot basis. Do you see any synergies with the digital currency and UPI?

When you look at UPI, we are all about retail payments, and when you talk about CBDC [central bank digital currency] in India, the RBI is running a pilot with about two to three million people participating. When it comes to NPCI International, our focus is to promote retail payments from around the world using apps from across India—BHIM, PhonePe, GooglePay etc. Right now, we have so much to deliver that we are not thinking about CBDC. Our focus is on retail payments outside India as well as people remitting money to India.



Q. What can we expect in the next few years?

You will see expansion of the network as more countries join the merchants’ payment network—countries that are relevant where Indians go for tourism or business. We will expand our network to include other countries of importance. You will also see efforts on the marketing part. Today, if you go to a store in Singapore, it may be offering UPI, but you may not see the branding and so you may not be prompted to use your UPI apps. You will see a lot of investment in branding. And we would create awareness in India to tell people that when you travel to so many countries, you can use UPI.

This interlinkage aligns with the G20’s financial inclusion priorities of driving faster, cheaper and more transparent cross-border payments and will be a significant milestone in the development of infrastructure for cross-border payments between India and Singapore,"" said the RBI.""UPI-Paynow connectivity is a brilliant advance in bringing together large-scale real-time payment networks. It can make seamless payments cost-effective and accessible to everyday consumers, such as students, tourists, and foreign workers. It will change the world of remittances.More importantly, this partnership can provide a durable proof point to use real-time networks for promoting cross-border trade, commerce, and investments. The opportunities for businesses, consumers and investors to benefit are genuinely unprecedented,"" said Sandeep Patil – Partner, Head of Asia – QED Investors."

However, he did not give any definite timeline for the launch.

“In terms of more interoperability partnerships like what we did in France and Singapore, we will focus on countries which are of importance to Indians when they travel abroad or where we have significantly large Indian diaspora residing like the Middle East and North America and these are the target market for us in the coming days"" reported Moneycontrol quoting NIPL CEO as saying in an interaction.

The global partnerships for UPI adoption have come through the NIPL, incorporated in April 2020, devoted to the deployment of RuPay and UPI outside of India.

Shukla said NIPL has different strategic partnerships in different countries. In some countries, NIPL is a focusing on infrastructure building and in some others, it is focusing on interoperability build.

Shukla said the NIPL is helping various countries create an infrastructure similar to UPI by making their own sovereign payment platform. At the same time the NIPL is also working on interoperability. The NPCL subsidiary is connecting the ecosystem in India to other ecosystems in various countries to help Indians traveling abroad,"" he added.

The UPI's global aspirations took a big leap forward after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 14, during his visit to Paris, said Indian tourists will be able to make rupee payments using UPI from atop the Eiffel Tower.

Similarly, on February 21, India launched the linkage of cross-border connectivity with PayNow of Singapore.

The UPI facility is seeing international extension to inbound foreign travelers from G20 countries for making merchant payments and non-resident Indians (NRIs) in selected international countries.

Earlier in February, Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said India has signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with 13 countries including Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, South Korea, and Japan that want to adopt the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) for digital payments.

Nepal became the first foreign country to deploy UPI as a payment platform. With the collaboration between Nepal's Manam Infotech and Gateway Payments Service, person-to-person (P2P), person-to-merchant (P2M), and cross-border payments have been made operational.

“UPI going global means that we are adding another dimension…We are creating acceptance for various UPI-powered apps in other markets…Singapore launch received a lot of excitement and we are approaching and getting approached by newer markets to develop something similar,"" Moneycontrol reported quoting Shukla as saying.

While the UPI platform going global will accelerate cross-border transactions in a faster and easier way, experts also say that the adoption of UPI globally will further accelerate the growth of transaction volumes.

“UPI is a platform that is enabling Indian consumers with various bank accounts being able to pay for their merchant and personal payments. The utilisation or destination was confined to India and now it is changing as UPI is going global,"" Shukla added.

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has allowed NRIs living in 10 countries to use UPI using their international mobile numbers for bank accounts which are classified as Non-Resident External (NRE) or Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) accounts. ET Online explains all you need to know.Until recently, an NRI would require a valid Indian mobile number to set up a UPI ID for any application. When a user activates UPI from an application, the app then sends an SMS from the number confirming that the mobile number is linked to the bank account.So, those who moved overseas had to keep their Indian mobile numbers active, if they wanted to use UPI in India. It would come with the cost of maintaining the phone number and paying an amount to recharge it every month. Now, these NRIs can use UPI with their international or non-Indian mobile numbers. This move will eliminate the maintenance cost of keeping an Indian mobile number active for NRIs.During the first phase of the roll-out, UPI can be used by NRI mobile numbers having country codes of Singapore, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Oman, Qatar, USA, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom, as per an NPCI circular released on January 10, 2023.1) Mobile numbers of NRIs must be linked with NRO or NRE accounts to activate UPI with international mobile numbers.2) Moreover, the NRE or NRO accounts should be Know your Customer or KYC compliant to activate UPI, Praveena Rai, COO of NPCI told ET Now.The member bank where the customer has an NRE or NRO account must ensure that the required KYC is done and other necessary regulations including the Foreign Exchange Management Act or FEMA are followed, NPCI said earlier.“The onus of compliance will rest with the respective banks.

India has risen as the topmost country for digital payment transactions in recent years. Last year, India recorded more digital payment transactions than those in the US, China and Europe combined.1 This is thanks to the Unified Payments Interface (‘UPI’) introduced by National Payments Corporation of India (‘NPCI’) about seven years ago on April 11, 2016. Every month, the number of UPI transactions continue to surpass those of the previous month. According to the NPCI, for the month of May 2023, the total number of monthly UPI transactions reached a record 9.4 billion with the transaction value of record INR 14.89 trillion (about USD 181 billion).2

India’s rise as the global leader in digital payments is attributable to its robust technological infrastructure and timely regulatory interventions. As UPI enables instant mobile-to-mobile payments at practically no cost, millions of people have adopted it as the primary mode of payments. Every UPI transaction is required to use two-factor authentication, a passcode or PIN for accessing any UPI app as well to confirm the transaction. Thus, UPI has become a highly secure payment mechanism earning trust among its users.

Recently, India has undertaken various initiatives to extend the reach of UPI beyond its borders and make it a truly global payment system. We have described below the Indian and country-wise initiatives on cross-border and international UPI payment facilities.

INDIA INITIATIVES

NPCI is a non-profit umbrella organisation set up by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) that operates retail payments and settlement systems in India. Since 2020,3 NPCI has taken several steps to enable the use of UPI globally for international peer-to-peer and merchant payments.

1. UPI Global

The NPCI mandated that all stakeholders – i.e. member banks, third party application providers and other payment providers – provide UPI Global by December 31, 2021.4 While this timeline was extended to September 30, 2022 to accommodate additional members that had not implemented the feature at the issuer and UPI app level5, no further extension has been granted by NPCI. PhonePe was the first Indian fintech to support cross-border UPI payments. Users of PhonePe can pay through their Indian bank accounts to merchants at merchant outlets or points-of-sale in the UAE, Singapore, Mauritius, Nepal, and Bhutan.6 Paytm has also announced that it will launch support for UPI Global payments.7

2. UPI for Non-Resident Indians

As per NPCI’s circular dated January 10, 20238, non-resident accounts like Non-Resident External (NRE) and Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) Accounts with international mobile numbers are allowed to be on-boarded and transact using UPI. To begin with, mobile numbers from the following ten countries would be permitted - United States, United Kingdom, Singapore, Canada, Australia, Oman, Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong. The responsibility of adherence to foreign exchange laws and RBI guidelines is on member banks, and anti-money laundering compliance is the responsibility of the remitter and beneficiary banks.

3. UPI for Foreign Travellers in India

The RBI Master Directions (‘PPI MD’) on Prepaid Payment Instruments (‘PPIs’) were amended in February 2023.9 laying down provisions for issuance of PPIs to foreign nationals and NRIs visiting India (together, ‘Travellers’). The PPI MD states that INR denominated full-KYC PPIs can be granted to Travellers, beginning with those travelling to India from G20 countries. Inbound travellers to India can avail UPI facilities through PPIs issued to them. To begin with, this facility has been offered to inbound travellers from G20 countries for merchant payments at select international airports -- New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru airports.10 Currently, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and two non-bank issuers, Pine Labs Private Limited and Transcorp International Limited, issue UPI-linked wallets. In February 2023, EbixCash was the first entity to provide UPI services to the travellers as part of a pilot testing phase.11

Traveller PPIs are issued in the form of e-wallets linked to UPI, after physical verification of the Travellers’ passports and visas. Traveller PPIs can only be loaded/reloaded against the receipt of foreign currency in cash or through any other payment instrument, and the Traveller PPIs can only be used for merchant payments. The amount outstanding on the Traveller PPI cannot be more than INR 200,000 at any given time.

BILATERAL INITIATIVES

Several digital economies such as the UK, Singapore and UAE have partnered with India’s NPCI, through the latter’s wholly owned subsidiary, NPCI International Payments Limited (‘NIPL’). The partnerships propose to offer seamless cross-border payments, allowing Indians to use UPI in Singapore for real-time peer-to-peer and merchant transactions, and in the UK and UAE for real-time peer-to-merchant transactions.

1. Singapore

Singapore has been actively promoting its Payments Roadmap that covers initiatives such as common QR codes for accepting payments, unified points of sale, and PayNow.12

The RBI and the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced in September 2021 that they would link their fast payment systems i.e., UPI and PayNow respectively.13 Chia Ling Koh, Managing Director at Osborne Clarke Singapore, remarks: “UPI - PayNow is currently offered by DBS and non-bank payment institution Liquid Group. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has been issuing non-bank payment institution licences under the relatively new Payments Services Act. Without a doubt, the payments services market is getting competitive in Singapore.”

The UPI - PayNow linkage should enable fund transfers between users in India and users in Singapore. The transfers from users in India to those in Singapore can be done using mobile phone numbers, and from Singapore to India using UPI virtual payment addresses. Further, Indian users visiting or living in Singapore can make payments to merchants in Singapore using their bank UPI apps.14

Peer-to-peer transactions

The UPI - PayNow linkage was operationalised in February 2023.15 The account holders of participating banks and financial institutions in Singapore and India can undertake cross-border remittance transactions via UPI and PayNow. As per the RBI FAQs on the UPI-PayNow linkage,16 six Indian banks17 are currently enabled for receiving remittances through the linkage, and four Indian banks18 are currently enabled to send the remittances. The FAQs list the apps and platforms offered19 by the above-mentioned banks that can be used as long as a user’s UPI ID is registered with the bank. There are two participating entities from Singapore20 for receiving and sending remittances.

A daily transaction limit of INR 60,000 (about SGD 1,000) is applicable, and presently, only peer-to-peer remittances for the purposes of maintenance of relatives abroad & gifts are allowed. The RBI’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (‘LRS’) limit of USD 250,000 per financial year per individual will be applicable. P2M transactions have not been enabled via on the linkage. The linkage allows real time transactions, similar to domestic UPI transactions.

Users should be able to commence using this feature when the participating banks roll-out an update in their respective UPI apps. As of June 2023, we were unable to locate the payment and receiving feature on certain listed apps.

Peer-to-merchant transactions

For peer-to-merchant transactions, UPI is accepted in Singapore by select merchants via BHIM, the mobile payment app developed by NPCI based on the underlying UPI infrastructure. BHIM is linked to PayNow, and Indian users in Singapore can pay using BHIM UPI by scanning QR codes at select merchants in Singapore. The UPI feature on apps from the following banks can be used by Indians for cross-border merchant payments using PayNow: City Union Bank, UCO Bank, Bank of Baroda and Punjab & Sindh Bank. At the time of payment, the BHIM app will automatically convert and display the amount from Singapore Dollars to Indian Rupees, for ease of reference for the Indian payer. The transaction rate applicable for using UPI at a merchant (through the NETS QR code) is 1.8% of the transaction value.21

2. UAE

NIPL has collaborated with various institutions in the UAE such as Mashreq Bank’s subsidiary NeoPay22, the Arab Monetary Fund through Buna23 (a cross-border payment system), and Network International, an organization enabling digital commerce in the MENA region.24 These partnerships aim to help implement payment solutions that will lead to interoperability with UPI, and help Indians make seamless payments to merchants in the UAE. NeoPay has begun accepting payments through BHIM UPI across NeoPay enabled shops and merchant stores. Additionally, PhonePe has enabled UPI transactions at merchant stores and points of sale in the UAE. This will help with peer-to-merchant payments for Indians in the UAE.

3. UK

The UK has set up Faster Payment System (FPS) with private participation of payment start-ups that enable real time payments online or via telephone banking, of up to GBP 1 million.25 The NIPL signed a memorandum of understanding with PayXpert to enable acceptance of UPI in the UK.26 This collaboration is to enable Indian bank account holders to use UPI through PayXpert’s point of sale devices in the UK for in-store payments, including through UPI-based QR code payments. This partnership is expected to provide Indian travellers with a familiar and convenient way to make payments in the UK.

4. Bhutan, Nepal… and the World

In similar efforts, the NPCI collaborated with Bhutan early on, with Bhutan being the first country to adopt UPI standards for its QR code deployment, and the first country to accept mobile based payments through BHIM.27

Further, in furtherance of India’s Neighbourhood First Policy, Nepal adopted UPI for their digital transactions in February 2022. NIPL joined hands with Gateway Payments Service and Manam Infotech to provide the services in Nepal, for both peer-to-peer and merchant payments.28 PhonePe currently has enabled peer to merchant payments through UPI in Nepal and Bhutan.

NIPL has also set its eyes on partnerships with global private fintech players. It joined hands with TerraPay, a global payments infrastructure company, by signing an MOU that will allow Indian residents with a UPI ID to receive real-time international payments through TerraPay29. NIPL signed a similar MOU with PPRO, to enable offering of RuPay card and UPI acceptance across PPRO’s global clients such as payment service providers (PSPs) and global merchant acquirers.30

NPCI is presently working towards enabling cross-border transactions with several other countries. It aims to collaborate with at least 30 more countries including Australia and France.31 Significantly low costs and the secure mechanism for conducting UPI-based digital transactions is likely to benefit many developing countries too, as they aspire to establish digital financial infrastructure to build a globally integrated digital economy.

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

1. Data Storage

The RBI’s circular on ‘Storage of Payment System Data’ dated April 6, 201832 (“DL Circular”) acknowledged safety and security measures required in digital payments. It mandated that all payment system providers and banks must store data relating to payment systems operated by them only in India. Complete end-to-end transaction details should be part of the data stored.33 For the foreign leg of the transaction, the data may be stored in the foreign country.

Further, processing of payment transactions outside India may be carried out.

In such case, the data may be stored outside India during such time but should be stored only in India after the processing, Wherein processing is done outside India, the data should be deleted from the systems abroad and brought back to India no later than 1 business day or 24 hours from the payment processing, whichever is earlier, Subsequent activities such as settlement processing after the payment processing, if done outside India should be done on a real-time basis and the data should be stored only in India during such process, and In case of any other related processing activity, such as chargeback, etc., the data can be accessed, at any time, from India where it is stored.

Though the DL Circular does not specifically mention UPI within its scope, the DL Circular should apply to cross-border UPI transactions. This is because the NPCI is authorised by the RBI as a retail payments organisation, and the DL Circular should apply to the NPCI and the bank members that are a part of the NPCI and that process UPI transactions. The DL Circular has been previously enforced by the NPCI against all digital payment platform members in May 2020, requiring the members to submit system audit reports to demonstrate compliance with the DL Circular.34

2. Foreign Exchange Control

In India, all transactions involving foreign currency are controlled by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (‘FEMA’). FEMA treats “capital account transactions” separately from “current account transactions.” Current account transactions, under the Section 2(i) of FEMA, are transactions that include “payments due in connection with foreign trade, other current business, services, and short-term banking and credit facilities in the ordinary course of business” and “remittances for living expenses of parents, spouse and children residing abroad”35 UPI transactions are typically undertaken for purchase of goods, services, or peer-to-peer payments, and not for purchase of assets such as immovable property. Therefore, peer-to-peer and merchant UPI Global transactions are likely to fall under current account transactions.

UPI Global transactions would fall under the LRS limit for resident individuals of USD 250,000 per financial year,36 and should not be exempt from the limit unless specifically exempted by amendment of the Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) Rules, 2000 (‘Current Account Rules’). For example, the erstwhile Rule 7 of the Current Account Rules had exempted international credit card transactions made when the card holder is outside India from requiring prior RBI approval and had kept such transactions outside the LRS limit. This rule was omitted by way of amendment in May 202337.

While there are no restrictions imposed by the NPCI circulars on what UPI Global may be used for, as on date, the cross-border UPI transactions can be used for peer-to-peer remittances for gifts and maintenance of relatives abroad.38 If UPI cross-border transactions are classified as current account transactions, future UPI Global transactions should be permitted under the Current Account Rules, unless:

The transactions are prohibited, such as remittances from lottery winnings, racing / riding income or any other hobby, remittances towards lottery tickets, sweepstakes, banned/proscribed magazines, football pools etc., remittance for payment of commission on exports made towards equity investment in joint ventures/ wholly owned subsidiaries abroad of Indian companies, remittance of dividend by any company to which the requirement of dividend balancing is applicable, etc.39 The transactions require prior approval of the Government of India such as remittances towards cultural tours,40 or The total remittances of the individual in a financial year exceed the limits under LRS.41

CONCLUSION

The promotion and acceptance of UPI by a variety of countries demonstrates that cross-border transactions using UPI are only set to grow. This is in furtherance of the acceptance of RuPay cards in Singapore and the UAE42, and the Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) that will soon be able to accept cross-border inward payments.43 The RBI Annual Report 2022 also provides recommendations in relation to cross-border UPI such as geotagging of existing payment touchpoints and expanding literacy initiatives.44

The benefits of enabling cross-border UPI payments include:

ease of remittances from and to India, for countries where peer-to-peer payments are enabled, as in the case of Singapore, ease of payments for Indian residents visiting other countries, such as tourists and short-term visitors, ease of transactions for Indian students studying abroad, and ease of shopping from merchants outside of India, without requiring international payments through debit/credit cards, in countries where the collaboration extends beyond point-of-sale machines.

While agreements have been entered into with various countries and entities in foreign countries, effective implementation on-ground and proliferation of UPI usage may take some time and may need to overcome some teething issues. UPI has changed the way payment transactions are happening in India. Within a short-span of few years, India’s cash-based economy is rapidly transitioning to a digital transaction economy. Such society-transforming innovations have global benefits. The partnerships with established international payment service providers indicate a positive push to enable access to UPI for potential users across the world. In addition, the reach of UPI is aiding India’s push to internationalize the rupee. This is a great step towards India’s globalisation efforts and could establish India as a truly global digital economy.

According to the RBI, banks and non-banks authorised to issue prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) can issue rupee-denominated full-KYC PPIs to foreign nationals and NRIs visiting India. Such PPIs can also be issued in co-branding arrangement with entities authorised to deal in foreign exchange under FEMA, it said.

The PPIs can be issued in the form of wallets linked to UPI — like Google Pay and PhonePe — and can be used for merchant payments (P2M) only. Loading and reloading of such PPIs will be against receipt of foreign exchange by cash or through any payment instrument, the RBI said.

Who can utilise this system?

To start with, this facility will be extended to travellers from the G-20 countries, arriving at select international airports. Going forward, this facility will be enabled across all other entry points in the country, the RBI said. The G-20 comprises Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, EU, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the UK and the US.

How are PPIs issued?

The PPIs can be issued after physical verification of Passport and Visa of the customers at the point of issuance. The PPI issuers should ensure that such information and record thereof are maintained with them, the RBI said.

The conversion to Indian rupee can be carried out only by entities authorised to deal in foreign exchange under FEMA. The amount outstanding at any point of time in such PPIs should not exceed the limit applicable on full-KYC PPIs, it said.

The unutilised balances in such PPIs can be encashed in foreign currency or transferred ‘back to source’ (payment source from where the PPI was loaded), in compliance with foreign exchange regulations, the RBI said.

What’s UPI?

UPI, managed by the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), is a system that powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features, seamless fund routing & merchant payments into one hood. Immediate money transfer through mobile devices round the clock and 365 days is possible through UPI wallets. It involves a single mobile application for accessing different bank accounts."

The projections state that the UPI will take over 90 per cent of all payment transactions in India in near future. The system employs a Virtual Payment Address (VPA) established by the user.

In recent times, countries such as Sri Lanka, France, UAE, and Singapore have joined initiatives with India to explore innovative fintech and payment solutions.

In July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the agreement between India and France to adopt the UPI payment mechanism.

Singapore is the first country with which a cross-border person-to-person (P2P) payment process has been launched. The facility is expected to particularly benefit the Indian diaspora to carry out quick and cost-efficient money transactions just by scanning QR codes. Lauding the initiative, Mehul said that it will serve as inspiration for other countries looking to harness technology to enhance business across borders.

The India-Singapore cross-border real-time payment system was launched on February 21 by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das, and Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong virtually attended the launch event.

""The PayNow-UPI linkage will offer cheaper, faster, and safer cross-border retail payments and remittances, for businesses and individuals alike, directly between bank accounts or e-wallets,"" Singapore's Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loo expressed hope that the ""strong partnership"" will continue to result in innovative technology solutions.

The PayNow-UPI project is the world’s first real-time payment systems linkage to use a scalable cloud-based infrastructure which can accommodate future increases in the volume of remittance traffic, according to a statement by MAS.

On Sunday, PM Modi in his monthly radio broadcast said that many countries are showing interest in the country’s UPI and the bilateral agreement with Singapore will bolster ease of living through digitalisation.

“Now, people of Singapore and India are transferring money from their mobile phones in the same way as they do within their respective countries. I am glad that people have started taking advantage of it,” Modi said in the latest edition of Mann ki Baat.

Between 2021 and 2022, the volume of UPI transactions jumped by over 90% and the value by 76%. For a diverse and complex geography like India, the success of UPI is remarkable, for it brought digital payments closer to the tech savvy as well as to the masses.

The innovative platform’s ease of use and acceptance has transformed the way Indians make payments and fund transfers. However, non-resident Indians (NRI) did not have access to this service, until now.

Game changer: NPCI’s (National Payments Corporation of India) notification allowing NRIs to link their international mobile numbers with UPI for payments and fund transfer is a step in the right direction with potentially game changing results. India is the world’s largest international remittance (IR) destination. According to the World Bank, for the first time, a single country, India, is on track to receiving more than $100 billion in yearly remittances in 2022, up from over $89 billion in 2021. Looking at the IR trends, UPI is well placed to replicate the domestic success by tapping the demand for international payments. With their request to allow UPI becoming a reality now, NRIs would be keen to make the most of this platform for seamless and safe transactions.

To start with, NPCI has allowed NRIs from 10 countries—Singapore, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Oman, Qatar, US, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom—to avail UPI services to send and receive money. Interestingly, the US and the UAE markets are the biggest remitters to India.

NRIs can use the service only if their domestic bank accounts such as Non Resident External (NRE) and Non Resident Ordinary (NRO) are linked to their international phone numbers. An NRE bank account allows NRIs to park their foreign earnings in the country. An NRO bank account helps them manage the income earned in India. These incomes include rent, dividend, pension, interest, etc.

Advantages aplenty: With an estimated 18 million expats, Indians constitute the world’s largest diaspora group. For the large working population and students abroad, enabling UPI for international transactions has significant advantages.

Safety: UPI uses virtual ID for a transaction, making it more secure as bank account details are not shared. Further, UPI’s stringent guidelines to comply with Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism regulations is a great safety net.

Faster service: Being a digital and phone-based platform, UPI facilitates faster remittance compared to other options currently in use. This is especially beneficial during emergency situations such as medical situations, payment of student fees, etc. NRIs can also pay domestic utility bills instantly using their UPI ID.

Low cost: As per Remittances Prices Worldwide Database of the World Bank, the cost of sending $200 to a South Asian country, including India, is 4.1% on an average. UPI enables easier, faster and cheaper remittance services.

Reduced dependency: With UPI, one can make payments and fund transfers directly to the intended beneficiary without the need to route through a friend or relative’s bank accounts.

Simplified payments: All that NRIs need to do is to link their NRE and NRO accounts that are linked to their international SIM to UPI. Once a virtual ID is created, one can use it like a regular Indian UPI user for making any merchant or P2P payment.

Social value: The NRI gets to showcase UPI as a world class product to their peers overseas. The ability to say this is good social currency. UPI as a payment tool today is an intrinsic part of the daily lives of common Indians. This as a mode of sending money home just seamlessly fits into their everyday lives. For domestic banks, including payments banks, this is a window of opportunity to garner NRI deposits and enable seamless digital transactions. With significant rural reach, we expect the new UPI initiative to further deepen the use of digital payments in Bharat.

For India, UPI is a story of the country’s strong fintech ecosystem driven by the desire to innovate for greater good and bigger impact, with customer at the centre.

UPI scams on the rise: Here's how you can protect yourself - Business Today,UPI scams on the rise: Here's how you can protect yourself  Business Today,"Tue, 30 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://consent.google.com/m?continue=https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL3RlY2gtdG9kYXkvdHJlbmRpbmcvc3RvcnkvdXBpLXNjYW1zLW9uLXRoZS1yaXNlLWhlcmVzLWhvdy15b3UtY2FuLXByb3RlY3QteW91cnNlbGYtMzgzNTEyLTIwMjMtMDUtMzDSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3N0b2RheS5pbi9hbXAvdGVjaC10b2RheS90cmVuZGluZy9zdG9yeS91cGktc2NhbXMtb24tdGhlLXJpc2UtaGVyZXMtaG93LXlvdS1jYW4tcHJvdGVjdC15b3Vyc2VsZi0zODM1MTItMjAyMy0wNS0zMA?oc%3D5&gl=FR&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in,"Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is India's success story on a global stage. UPI made digital transactions easy and accessible. However, it is also now the easiest way of getting scammed.

According to Ministry of Finance, more than 95,000 fraud cases linked to UPI transactions were recorded in 2022-23, an increase from 84,000 incidents in 2021-22.

In March 2023, the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) transactions reached a record high of 865 crores, valuing a record of Rs 14.07 lakh crore, as per a Times of India (TOI) report. The volume of transactions was 18 per cent more than in February 2023, from 728 crores.

UPI scams are usually the easiest but more importantly, it is often impossible to reverse the transaction, and is difficult to prove for the victim to prove that he or she has been scammed.

The scammers usually send a smaller amount of money to their target and then reach out to them to address the mistake. It is then followed by a request of an amount bigger than agreed upon while being on the call. Further, under the pressure of the moment, the targets fall prey by accepting the UPI request and transferring the money after entering their UPI PIN.

The reason that UPI scams are difficult to investigate is that a scam is proven when fraud has taken place. But in UPI scams, the predators make sure that their targets are voluntarily entering the UPI PIN and enabling the transaction. When a person shares the UPI PIN with another person, there's no way to remedy or reverse the situation. In another case, where the victim misunderstands the request and enters the PIN by himself, in that case as well, the PIN was entered voluntarily and so there is no case to build.

Recently, Google Pay's interface has incorporated regular reminders on the app. Anytime a person tries to send money to an account, GPay, on the page that requires the user to enter the PIN now displays a message at the bottom.

According to Delhi Police, scammers usually send some amount through UPI apps such as Paytm, Google Pay, PhonePe, etc. to their potential target and then call them saying it was a mistake, TOI report added.

How to stay safe from UPI scams?

1. Do NOT share your UPI ID or PIN with anybody.

Just like CVV and OTP, UPI PIN must not be shared with anyone as access to these numbers provides a direct opportunity for people to swipe money out of the accounts.

2. Regularly change your UPI PIN

Changing your UPI PIN often helps steer away from the possibility of getting hacked.

3. Do not use public Wi-Fi for UPI payments

It is always better to use your own mobile internet or a Wi-Fi connection at your place and not connect to a public network, as that could open the floodgates of your data and bank accounts.

This indigenous innovation has played a pivotal role in transitioning from a cash-based economy to a technologically empowered one.

UPI has played a key role since the time it was first introduced in 2016 and made India a global leader in the realm of next-generation real-time payments infrastructure. In developed countries, merchants (small retail shops/cabs) are equipped with Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals. However, a few years ago in India, many merchants lacked any payment infrastructure. This is where Unified Payments Interface (UPI) emerged as a pivotal player, revolutionizing the country’s payment landscape.

At present, UPI reigns supreme as the most favored mode of digital payment for end users. Its popularity can be attributed to its features of being free, safe, swift, seamless, flexible, and convenient. With continuous advancements in technology and evolving consumer preferences, the UPI payment ecosystem is ever-changing, constantly becoming more accessible, efficient, and secure.

Amidst this dynamic scenario, we bring your attention to five key trends shaping the future of UPI payments:

Cross Border Payments

The indigenous UPI solution is steadily gaining international appeal and is poised to garner even wider acceptance in foreign markets, driving the surge in cross-border transactions. To meet the demands of Indian travellers abroad, the Indian Government has extended UPI services to several international countries, simplifying transactions for NRIs, and reducing the costs of fund transfers and remittance payments. Notably, countries like France, Bhutan, Nepal, Oman, UAE, Vietnam, Singapore, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and Europe are now accepting UPI payments.

Moreover, India’s robust digital payment ecosystem is attracting worldwide attention, evidenced by the signing of MOUs with 13 countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, South Korea, and Japan, expressing their intent to adopt UPI for their digital payment systems. Nepal has already taken the lead by becoming the first foreign country to embrace UPI as its payment platform, enabling various payment options for its operations.

Experts predict a surge in transaction volumes, further bolstering the platform’s global presence. As UPI becomes accessible to a larger customer base, the scale of UPI transactions is bound to increase substantially. The success of India’s Make-in-India innovative payment solution demonstrates its global reach, contributing to the Digital India initiative. Travellers can now experience the convenience of easy, seamless, and hassle-free UPI transactions wherever they go.

Linking RuPay credit cards to UPI

The integration of RuPay credit cards with UPI marks a revolutionary step in the digital payments landscape, combining the advantages of both credit cards and UPI for consumers.

With millions of Indians already utilizing UPI apps for online transactions, its convenience has garnered widespread acceptance among merchants and customers alike. Now, with the ability to link credit cards to UPI, the level of ease for consumers escalates significantly, eliminating the need to carry their physical cards. This move is set to drive digital payment adoption to new heights, particularly in areas where POS terminals are not easily accessible.

Although initially rolled out for RuPay credit cards, the larger objective is to extend this functionality to other cards, broadening the customer base and enhancing safety by securely putting card data in the hands of users. This transformation will further establish QR Codes as a ubiquitous method for both debit card/account and credit card-based payments.

By taking advantage of the short-term credit facility offered by credit cards for UPI transactions, cardholders can now initiate payments using their credit lines instead of drawing from their savings accounts. This not only provides added convenience but also encourages a rise in cashless transactions.

Additionally, integration mitigates risks associated with skimming at POS terminals or the loss of physical cards, further enhancing the security of transactions.

The RBI’s approval to link RuPay credit cards with UPI brings together the best of both worlds, empowering consumers with enhanced payment options, convenience, and security, ultimately propelling India towards a more cashless and digitally inclusive economy.

Offline Payments – UPI 123Pay

One of the most significant developments in the world of digital payments last year was the introduction of UPI 123Pay, catering to feature phone users and offering a gateway to the burgeoning digital landscape. Surprisingly, in this era of smartphones, there are many Indians still relying on feature phones. Recognizing this, the RBI’s extension of UPI 2.0 brought forth an innovative solution independent of the type of phone or internet connectivity.

With UPI 123Pay, feature phone users can now engage in a variety of digital transactions through four different approaches. These options include using the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, a feature phone-based app, missed calls, or proximity sound payment method. Moreover, the service is accessible in multiple regional languages, broadening its reach to areas where Hindi and English are not dominant. This localization has significantly increased its user base, especially in rural regions where regional languages prevail.

As more people embrace this feature, we can anticipate a profound shift towards digital payments in India. UPI 123Pay is a game-changer in the Indian digital payments landscape, ushering in greater financial inclusion and empowerment for feature phone users. Its reach, simplicity, and potential for widespread adoption make it a promising step towards a more digitally driven economy.

UPI AUTOPAY – Recurring payments

Revolutionizing recurring payments, UPI Autopay offers a hassle-free solution that streamlines the authorization and management of pre-approved debits from users’ bank accounts. This latest feature empowers users to set up one-time authentication for automatic payments.

By seamlessly linking their bank accounts, users can establish specific instructions for authorizing recurring payments at their desired intervals—be it daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. Once the authorization is in place, the predetermined amounts are automatically debited from the user’s account on the designated dates, sparing them from any further involvement in the payment process.

The versatility of UPI Autopay spans various use cases, encompassing utility bills, online subscriptions, loan EMIs, insurance premiums, and more. By simplifying the payment process, this feature ensures timely and seamless transactions without the need for manual intervention, granting users greater convenience and peace of mind.

UPI One World – Empowering foreign travellers

With UPI One World, the RBI has opened new possibilities for foreign travellers in India. Now, they can load PPI (Prepaid Payment Instrument) wallets linked to UPI, enabling seamless payments across all merchant outlets accepting QR-based UPI payments. Initially available for tourists from G-20 countries, these wallets will be accessible at select Indian airports. Additionally, the RBI has permitted two banks and two non-bank PPI issuers to offer this facility to foreign nationals outside the airport premises.

In the future, this feature may be extended to all foreign nationals visiting India. By facilitating UPI transactions for travellers, this move too is expected to boost the scale of UPI transactions significantly. This showcases India’s prowess in the digital payment industry and its contribution to nation-building.

In conclusion, the ever-evolving UPI ecosystem continues to reshape India’s digital payments landscape, driving financial inclusion, and accelerating the nation’s progress towards a cashless economy.

But when it comes to UPI payments, the age-old maxim ceases to apply. For almost every small transaction, consumers have migrated to the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) and have stopped using cash for almost all purposes whatsoever.

Jay Kotak, co-head of digital bank Kotak 811 and son of Uday Kotak, posted on X (formerly twitter) that he did not carry a wallet anywhere in India during the entire month and instead carried only his mobile phone.

He claimed to have made all payments via UPI including those for street snacks, medicines, restaurants and even tips.

And he is certainly not alone. From students to young professionals, small vendors to auto wallas and tea stall operator to momo sellers – everyone gives the option of making online payment via UPI. And most customers seem to be availing the option, too. This growing phenomenon seems quite evident when you scan through the monthly statistics shared by the NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India). Undoubtedly, number of UPI transactions has been growing month after month and year after year. In July, the total value of UPI transactions stood at ₹15.34 lakh crore, reporting a 44 percent year-on-year growth. In terms of number of transactions, the figure was 9.96 billion, reporting a 58 percent year-on-year growth. UPI is projected as a success story of India’s digital infrastructure around the world. From Bhutan to Nepal and UK to UAE, several countries have adopted UPI enabled payments, thus expanding the global footprint of Indian digital payment system. During his recent visit to France, PM Narendra Modi announced that Indian tourists will be able to use UPI during their visit to Eiffel Tower.

Germany’s Federal Minister for Digital and Transport Volker Wissing making payment to a vendor via UPI in India. This picture was posted by German Embassy in India on X.

When Germany’s Federal Minister for Digital and Transport Volker Wissing came to India recently, he experienced the convenience of UPI first-hand as he made a small payment to a vegetable vendor through UPI. The video of making the payment was also shared on X by German Embassy India's official handle. Counter-intuitively, it can be seen as an unhealthy practice to follow everywhere all the time. Let us explain why. 1 Bank statement: First of all, when you make every payment digitally, then it is recorded as a bank transaction. It leads to a longer bank statement at the end of the week, month, quarter and year. Imagine when you make nearly 10-15 transactions every day digitally, your monthly transactions can be anywhere between 300 and 450. So, six months later, if you are asked to send your bank statement for the purpose of raising a loan or something else, your statement may run into 200 odd pages. 2 Leaving a digital trail: When you are making every payment digitally, you are leaving a digital trail of what you did, where you went, what you ate, even how much you ate, and how many times you did that, so on and so forth. On the face of it, this appears harmless but when you understand the magnitude of data it generates, and how it can be used to manipulate your buying behaviour online through targeted adverts, you will definitely be more surprised than amused. 3 Extra spending: It has been asserted adequately enough and empirically proven that making payment digitally usually leads to a higher monetary outgo vis-à-vis making payments in cash. In other words, when you don’t see the physical money leaving your wallet, you end up spending more. On the other hand, when you make payments in cash, your monetary outgo is likely to remain in moderation. 4. Technological dependence: When you depend on your mobile device for every transaction under the sun, you are running the risk of putting all your eggs in one basket. In case your phone gets conked off, gets infected by a malware or the worst of all – gets lost, you are prone to get stranded. So, we can say that making payments in cash sometimes is not only a good habit but can really be a saviour particularly on the occasions when your smartphone doesn’t remain ‘smart’ anymore.

The project had attracted significant interest from a variety of major conglomerates, tech giants and financial institutions, including Amazon, Reliance, Facebook, Tata Group, Google, HDFC and ICICI.

The Reserve Bank of India had initially invited bids in 2021 for licenses to operate new retail payment and settlement systems across India. The project was called New Umbrella Entity, or NUE.

However, according to RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar, the project’s potential participants failed to propose “any innovative or infrastructural solutions.” Sankar emphasized the central bank’s interest in exploring ideas that go beyond incremental improvements or substitutes for existing technologies.

UPI, which now processes over 8 billion transactions a month, was inching closer to the 1 billion milestone in 2021. The central bank sought to mitigate concentration risk as UPI’s importance in the economy continued to grow, aiming to develop an alternative protocol that would alleviate strain on the existing system.

PhonePe and Google Pay were commanding the most market share in UPI in 2021 — not much has changed — and many industry participants saw NUE as a way to be early and aggressive with a new payments system.

In an earlier proposal, RBI sought NUEs to be interoperable with each other.

“Thus, NUEs do not have any proprietary access. However, NUEs can customize the networks to their business model and distribution capabilities. If a conglomerate is strong in e-commerce, the NUE could customize to the specific needs of that use-case. UPI has market share caps/calibrated growth for new players (e.g. WhatsApp). NUEs would not have such restrictions and might help with accelerated network effects for private players. Thus, NUEs customized design and self-governance could provide stronger capabilities. Unlike UPI’s generic payment network, NUEs will have customized networks based on use-cases,” Bernstein wrote in a report in 2021."

Meta said the feature to accept payments through WhatsApp is available only to a few businesses at the moment. But it plans to expand the availability to more merchants over the coming months. Businesses can set up this feature through WhatsApp Business, which will guide them on getting a Stripe account too.

“Most people I know in Singapore use WhatsApp to chat with each other. Now, they can pay local businesses using the app as well. The speed and convenience of payments through WhatsApp will help businesses expand their revenue streams with new channels and access a wider customer base,” Sarita Singh, regional head and managing director for Southeast Asia at Stripe, said in a statement.

WhatsApp first launched its payment services in India based on the country’s Unified Payment Interface (UPI) network in 2020 in test mode. In 2022, The National Payments Corporation of India allowed Meta to expand the service to 100 million users. Last August the company introduced an end-to-end shopping experience with Reliance Jio in India, letting customers order groceries using the app. Last month, WhatsApp also launched merchant payments in Brazil, after allowing peer-to-peer payments for nearly three years.

Mark Zuckerberg is now leaning into the chat app’s 2 billion user base to launch payment services in different regions. Given that WhatsApp doesn’t have subscription fees or ads, its business offerings are the marquee method for Meta to earn money from the app. Starting next month, WhatsApp is also switching from a notification-based pricing system to a conversation-based pricing structure for usage of its Business services."

The story so far:

As transactions facilitated by the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) breach record highs, banks have opted for daily limits. These are over and above the already imposed ceilings mandated by the facilitator, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), in 2021. The idea is to sustain the smoother functioning of the payments interface as it continues to acquire popularity.

What is the conversation about daily limits?

At present, users can make up to 20 transactions or ₹1 lakh in a single day — either all at once or through the day. For certain specific categories of transactions such as the capital markets, collections (such as bills, among others), insurance and forward inward remittances, the limit is ₹2 lakh. In December 2021, the limit for the UPI-based ASBA (Application Supported by Blocked Amount) IPO and retail direct schemes was increased to ₹5 lakh for each transaction.

The conversation now revolves around banks and apps coming up with their own guidelines for transactions. For example, state-run lenders Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda has set its transaction limit at a much lower ₹25,000. PNB’s daily limit is ₹50,000. As for apps, among others, Google Pay users breach the daily limit if they try to send money more than ten times in a single day across all UPI apps.

As the payments interface looks to expand its footprint (recall the boarding of non-resident accounts having international numbers into the ecosystem) and its growing utility in daily lives, limits would help maintain an essential security infrastructure and its seamless functioning. This is also important as the interface looks to expand its use-case, as also called for in the proposed pilot project for coin-vending machines with UPI as the facilitator.

What does the industry think?

Digital payments app PhonePe’s spokesperson told The Hindu, “The limits are set balancing out customer convenience and potential fraud/risk concerns. The NPCI has also increased the value limit in specific categories where the average transaction value is higher such as Capital Markets or Credit Card Bill payments.”

Explained | Will consumers now have to pay for transactions made with PPIs via UPI?

As for the moves impacting the future growth, “All the ecosystem participants, the NPCI and the regulator regularly review the transaction and value limits on UPI and implement the requisite changes where the need exists”, the official said referring to the higher limits for IPOs, broking, mutual funds, loan repayment etc.

What are the most recent trends observed with respect to UPI?

In May this year, the total number of transactions facilitated using UPI increased to 9,415.19 million. The combined value of such transactions also increased at a largely similar ₹14.89 lakh crore. The segregation in terms of P2P (peer-to-peer) and P2M (peer-to-merchant) is particularly interesting. In terms of volume, whilst P2P accounted for about 43% at 4,045.48 million, in terms of value its share scaled up to ₹11.45 lakh crore.

In the P2P category, the majority of the transactions were in the below ₹500 bracket (54.2%) whilst in the P2M category, the share in the same amount bracket stood at 84.3%. This gives an indication of its lower-down utility. Important to note that considering the varied nature of merchants and business, the nature of transactions can be categorised in favour of one whilst it should be on the other side.

However, important to note in this context, until February in the financial year 2022-23, the total number of reported UPI frauds had also increased about 13% in comparison to the previous financial year to 95,402. However, this was alongside a decline in the fraud to sales ratio at 0.0015%.

Thus, to combat the growing incidences, there is the imperative need to have safeguard infrastructure in a growing ecosystem."

FedNow, which has been in the works for the past four years, offers users a simple and convenient way to send and receive payments. It has clear similarities with India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) infrastructure, but there are several differences between the two systems. Mint explains how they differ.

How does FedNow work, and how does it differ from UPI?

FedNow, run by the US Federal Reserve, is actually closer to India’s Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system than UPI. Unlike UPI, FedNow does not use unique virtual addresses or a user’s phone number as the primary identifier. Instead, users need to login to their internet banking service and use their bank account number as well as a ‘routing number’ to make a real-time payment. The system, which will be online 24-hours a day round the year, will notify the US federal ledger in real time about payments and transfers made between users and merchants.

UPI, on the other hand, is operated by a non-government, non-profit entity, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). It comprises a set of application programming interface (API) – pieces of code – that apps can tap into for instant payments.

Which of the two is cheaper and safer?

It is too early to gauge how safe FedNow will be — the early-stage rollout began only last week. However, it is significantly more expensive than UPI. Users will have to pay a $25 (about ₹2,000) participation fee, $0.045 (about ₹3.7) per credit transfer (to be paid by the sender), and $0.01 for each request-for-payment message (to be paid by the requestor)

In comparison, UPI has so far been certified as a ‘digital public good’ and has zero transaction fees. According to a Forbes report from 24 July, the US Federal Reserve positioning FedNow as a premium service and not as a public utility.

Can FedNow achieve UPI’s popularity even as a paid service?

UPI has been an unequivocal success since its rollout in April 2016. It clocked over 9.3 billion transactions worth ₹14.7 trillion last month, according to NPCI data.

FedNow, according to media reports, is presently available to customers of only 25 banks and credit unions. Last month, the US Federal Reserve said JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp and other top banks have joined the network. However, until it is more widely available, it will be only partially usable since both the sender and receiver need to be customers of a participating bank.

Will FedNow become ubiquitous like UPI? Many exports think not. Eric McCune, expert partner at Bain & Co, told Forbes that adoption will “significantly vary by use case"", holding up as an example the real-time payment clearance service of The Clearing House, private firm.

A 2023 US banking report by financial consultant Cornerstone Advisors US banking report highlighted that real-time payments remain a premium service in the US, offered by less than half of all banks. In comparison, UPI is available to anyone with a bank account.

Media reports have also said that FedNow’s adoption is likely to be driven by enterprises, which means that the service could end up being used primarily by businesses to clear payments more quickly. In comparison, peer-to-peer (P2P) payments make up a huge chunk of UPI transactions – they accounted for 77% of the ₹14.7 trillion in transaction value recorded last month."

LONDON & MUMBAI, India, April 27, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PPRO, the leading digital payments infrastructure provider, has signed a strategic agreement with NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) to offer global partners access to Unified Payments Interface (UPI), India’s fastest-growing, real-time payment system, for cross-border transactions. Today’s agreement, supported by a new framework co-developed with NIPL, paves the way for the first merchants to go live in the coming months.

By connecting directly to UPI via PPRO’s digital payments infrastructure, international payment service providers (PSPs) enable merchants to tap into India's huge online consumer base easily and securely, without the need for setting up a legal entity in India, settlement to an India-based bank or for uploading invoices to clear funds. For consumers, this means they can seamlessly make cross-border purchases in Indian Rupees using their favourite payment method.

Launched in 2016, UPI is India’s most popular instant payment system, already processing 60% of all domestic payments. It has over 325 million active users, supports 390 banks and 100 third-party apps within a single mobile application. In March 2023 alone, UPI processed over 8.7 billion transactions, the highest since its launch.

Simon Black, CEO at PPRO, said: ""International payment service providers and their merchants can now easily tap into an e-commerce market that is expected to reach an estimated $111 billion next year1, and predicted to almost double to $200 billion by 20262. By integrating UPI into PPRO’s digital payments infrastructure through a single connection, we have removed all the operational complexity for our partners to sell cross-border into India at scale.""

Ritesh Shukla, CEO at NIPL, said: ""UPI has revolutionised the digital payments landscape in India and is respected globally for its role in simplifying and democratising payments. By partnering with PPRO, a market leader in the payments infrastructure space, which powers a vast PSP and merchant network, Indian consumers will now be able to shop online with merchants around the world and pay safely and easily using UPI.""

Express News Service

BENGALURU: In the last few years, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has become the preferred mode and also the inclusive mode of payment in the country. According to the Reserve Bank of India, over 26 crore digital payment transactions are processed daily by payment systems, of which the UPI system alone processes over two-thirds.

Last week, when the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) issued a circular regarding an interchange fee of 1.1% on UPI transactions, there was a lot of confusion and also questions about whether customers will be charged for UPI transactions.

But the retail payments and settlement body immediately clarified that there are no charges for a bank account to bank account-based UPI payments and that interchange charge has been introduced only for prepaid payment instrument (PPI) merchant transactions.

Paytm CEO and founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma tweeted that there is no charge to consumers for UPI payments from bank accounts or wallets (or from RuPay credit cards).

“For merchant-only if they agree to accept and ok to pay any charge levied by QR company, they will be activated. Right now the government is paying for payment charges to be charged to merchants for payments from UPI,” he said. From April 1, 2023, an interchange fee is being levied on merchant payments above R 2,000 to specified merchant categories.

No fee for the ultimate users

At present, when consumers do UPI transactions, who is bearing the cost? Shashank Sharma, Director at Scoreme Solutions, said the actual operators through the UPI, like Paytm, Google Pay etc and banks are bearing the operational cost as no fee was so far levied on the ultimate user - the customer.

“All transactions routed both by the commercial banks as also the payment facilitators operating through the UPI platform were bearing their respective costs depending on the number of transactions handled,” he added.

NPCI’s recent move will result in revenue generation for payment service providers, assisting them to achieve and maintain profitability on UPI transactions, said Akash Sinha, CEO and Co-Founder, of Cashfree Payments.

“This will in turn enable them to improve their service quality as well as innovate and devise effective solutions. This is significant in ensuring the interests of all stakeholders in the payments ecosystem, catalysing the sustainable growth of the sector,” Sinha added.

P2P & P2PM transactions

Sinha explained, “In Peer to Peer (P2P) payments, a user transfers funds from his bank account to another individual’s account using digital mediums like net banking and UPI. So, if an individual is sending money to friends, family or any other individual or a small business merchant’s bank account, it will not attract an interchange fee. As stated by NPCI, the interchange fee will not apply to P2P transactions or P2PM(peer-to-peer-merchant) transactions between a bank and the prepaid wallet.”

NPCI spoke about interchange fees in its circular. Who will have to pay for this? “The acquiring bank (which is the bank of the merchant) will have to pay the interchange to the Issuing Entity, and likely this charge will be recovered from the merchant in some form,” Harish Prasad, Head of Banking- India, FIS, told TNIE.

Prasad added that the PPI Issuers will benefit from this move as their service to use UPI for merchant payments using their wallet/card was not resulting in any direct revenue to the PPIs, and they have been out-of-pocket on the costs involved. In its vision statement, the RBI said UPI to register average annualised growth of 50% and IMPS / NEFT at 20%.

UPI is the payment method of choice for most of the customers in the current digital ecosystem. It offers the end customer security as well as convenience to transact, said Ramakrishnan Ramamurthy, Executive VP, of Worldline India.

“The scale of UPI has only been growing exponentially YoY. Given that it is a public good and at the centre of digital transformation in India, we do not see the commercials being enforced on it in the near future,” he added. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das at an event recently said that the launch of UPI in 2016 has revolutionised the payments ecosystem with about 803 crore transactions worth R13 lakh crore processed in January 2023 alone.

He said, “Our home-grown payment products, UPI and RuPay network, are enhancing their global footprint. The launch of UPI linkage with Singapore’s PayNow is a major step forward. In future, such linkages with other countries will make cross-border payments simple, affordable and real-time. QR code-based merchant payments through UPI apps are already enabled in Bhutan, Singapore and UAE.”

Future of UPI

When asked what the future of UPI looks like and how long can it be free? Harish Prasad said that neither consumers- account holders, nor merchants have had to pay for the service as a transaction-linked charge so far, and this situation has been described as unsustainable by many in the industry given the increasing costs for banks, issuers and PSPs of processing UPI transactions.

“This is putting a lot of pressure on NPCI and the regulator to relax this view, lest the quality of services starts to suffer,” he said. He does expect relaxations on this position to be incrementally introduced over the next year or two.

“The beauty of UPI is that it provides rails for a variety of use cases which can go well beyond retail payments and start to increasingly make sense for B2C, C2B and even B2B payments. The rails will also expand to cover more account types and that will also likely lead to further expansion in volumes. The simplicity of transacting via a simple identifier such as a phone number makes for a compelling benefits case for newer payment use cases,” he added.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is to add support for NFC payments to the country’s UPI Lite digital wallet, enabling users to conduct transactions on their smartphone even when there is no internet or mobile connection.

The RBI is adding the option to the stored value wallet — which was launched in September 2022 — to “optimise processing resources for banks, thereby reducing transaction failures,” the bank says.

“The product has gained traction and currently processes more than 10m transactions a month.

“To promote the use of UPI Lite, it is proposed to facilitate offline transactions using NFC technology. This feature will not only enable retail digital payments in situations where internet/telecom connectivity is weak or not available, it will also ensure speed, with minimal transaction declines.”

Paytm, the popular payments app, has introduced a new feature called UPI Lite that makes it easier for users to make small value transactions without needing to enter a PIN every time. For the unversed, UPI stands for Unified Payments Interface, a digital payments system that allows for real-time bank-to-bank transactions.The current setup allows users to enter their UPI payment before making a payment. Users also have the option of adding money to their wallet before making payment.

Talking about the new feature, Praveena Rai, COO, NPCI, said, “We are very excited to launch UPI LITE on Paytm Payments Bank. UPI LITE provides users a faster, secure, and seamless low-value transaction experience. With more than 50 per cent of transactions through UPI below Rs 200, UPI LITE will successfully provide a distributed way of authorizing low value transactions, moving them away from core banking. This shall further improve the success rate of transactions, enhancing the user experience, and taking us one more step closer to processing a billion transactions a day on the UPI platform.”

The UPI Lite will be beneficial to users, especially in situations that demand quicker actions. The users can make quick and seamless transactions of up to Rs 200 with just one click through Paytm. They can also add up to Rs 2,000 twice a day to their UPI Lite wallet, making the cumulative daily usage up to Rs 4000, Paytm said in the statement.

UPI Lite was designed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and launched by the Reserve Bank of India in September 2022. It allows for multiple small value transactions without hampering the multiple bank transactions. This feature is expected to help more people get used to digital payments.

Paytm Payments Bank is the largest acquiring and beneficiary bank in the UPI system and one of the leading remitter banks. As part of its efforts to drive innovation, it is the first payments bank to launch UPI Lite.

With UPI Lite, users can carry out a large number of small value UPI payments in a superfast manner. These transactions would only show up in the Paytm balance and history section and not in the bank passbook. This de-clutters the bank passbook of small value transactions.

Overall, UPI Lite is a convenient and hassle-free way to make small value digital transactions without needing to enter a PIN every time. It is expected to make digital payments even more accessible to people across India, especially those who are new to digital payments.

This innovative system aims to provide uninterrupted financial services even when conventional payment systems are temporarily unavailable due to disruptions in the underlying information and communication infrastructure.

Traditionally, payment systems such as Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) have relied on complex wired networks and advanced IT infrastructure to handle large volumes while ensuring sustained availability. However, these systems are susceptible to being rendered inoperative during natural calamities or periods of war, posing a significant challenge to the stability of the economy.

Also Watch | India's Q4 GDP growth pegged at 5.5%, FY23 growth seen at 7%; Will India continue to surpass China?

Understanding the importance of being prepared for extreme and volatile situations, the RBI has conceptualized the LPSS as a lightweight and portable payment system. This system will operate independently of conventional technologies and can be managed from any location with minimal staff requirements. Details about the new payments system have been shared in RB's latest annual report.

The LPSS is designed to function on minimalistic hardware and software, only becoming active when necessary. It will primarily focus on processing critical transactions essential for maintaining the stability of the economy, including government and market-related transactions. By providing near-zero downtime, this payment system aims to keep the liquidity pipeline of the economy intact. It will facilitate uninterrupted essential payment services, such as bulk payments, interbank payments, and the provision of cash to participant institutions.

By acting as a bunker equivalent in the realm of payment systems, it enhances public confidence in digital payments and financial market infrastructure.

UPI, a ground-breaking payment system, has propelled the nation into a future powered by seamless digital payments. Launched in 2016, UPI has become the most preferred mode of payment for many Indians, fostering the growth of an inclusive financial system. Today, the scan-and-pay UPI system is being used for all kinds of transactions, from thousands of rupees on luxury purchases to a 10-rupee cup of tea.

UPI’s user-friendly interface and convenience have simplified payment procedures. The platform has enabled small businesses to enhance their financial performance, creating new avenues for growth and expansion. As per a report, UPI transactions are expected to grow steadily, reaching a remarkable milestone of 1 billion daily transactions by 2026–27. This article dives deeper into UPI and its role in India’s journey towards a cashless economy.

Rise of UPI

UPI was launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016 and has rapidly gained momentum and revolutionised how Indians conduct transactions. At present, there are 300 million UPI users and 500 million merchants who use UPI to accept money for their businesses. This payment infrastructure enables users to link multiple bank accounts to a single mobile application, making real-time, peer-to-peer transactions possible with just a few taps on a smartphone. UPI connects over 300 banks and enables seamless financial transactions through TPAP (third-party application providers) like Google Pay, Amazon Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm in partnership with banking partners. The ease of use and accessibility of UPI have made it immensely popular across the nation, bridging the gap between urban and rural areas.

Empower Financial inclusion

One of the key strengths of UPI lies in its ability to empower even the most avoidable segments of society. UPI has played a pivotal role in bringing millions of unbanked and underbanked individuals into the formal banking system by facilitating instant and hassle-free transactions. This has opened avenues for financial services such as savings accounts, loans, and insurance, enabling individuals to build a secure financial future. UPI has empowered small businesses, street vendors, and rural communities by providing them with a digital payment infrastructure that is convenient, cost-effective, and secure.

Catalyst for Economic Growth

The impact of UPI extends beyond financial inclusion, as it has emerged as a catalyst for economic growth and development. UPI has facilitated a transition towards a transparent and accountable economy by reducing the dependence on cash transactions. The availability of transaction data through UPI has fuelled the growth of fintech companies and startups, driving innovation in the financial sector and creating employment opportunities.

Seamless Integration and Interoperability

UPI’s success can be attributed to its seamless integration across various banking platforms and its interoperability with numerous third-party applications. UPI’s open architecture allows developers to create innovative solutions, resulting in a vast ecosystem of UPI-enabled apps that offer a wide range of services, such as bill payments, online shopping, and fund transfers. This interoperability has eliminated the need for multiple payment apps and simplified the user experience, enabling individuals to transact effortlessly across different platforms.

Innovation and Future Prospects

The introduction of UPI 2.0 brought additional features such as an overdraft facility, invoice payments, and signed intent, further enhancing the user experience.

UPI is constantly evolving, which is visible from numerous developments that have taken place recently, like offering lending through the UPI stack, enabling RuPay card attachment to UPI, linking UPI to PPI, and increasing interchange income for prepaid cards to 1.1% of GMV and Credit Cards to 1.5% of GMV. This next level of innovation reflects the NPCI’s commitment to staying ahead of technological advancements and catering to the changing needs of the Indian population. Also, there will be a lot of opportunities for Fintechs and more additions in the coming days with further development in offline payments, UPI Lite, UPI QR becoming interoperable, and CBDC QR being supported.

To Conclude

UPI has emerged as a game-changer in India’s quest for a digital future. By enabling seamless, secure, and inclusive transactions, UPI has transformed the way Indians transact, empowering millions and driving economic growth. As UPI continues to evolve and innovate, its digital dynamo is set to propel India even further into the future, leaving an indelible mark on the global digital payments landscape. UPI has revolutionized India’s payment sector and is becoming more accessible to non-resident Indians in several nations.

Singapore, the U.K., Australia, Canada, and the U.S. are among these nations.

In a major effort to stifle the cross-border flow of money between the two countries, India and Singapore have linked their digital payment systems, UPI and PayNow, enabling rapid and inexpensive fund transfers.

According to the World Bank, India became the first nation to receive over $100 billion in inward remittances, and UPI’s soon-to-be-connected instant payment network of countries like Singapore, the UK, Australia, Canada, and the US will make cross-border inward payment experiences seamless and more cost-effective.

The report highlights that UPI is projected to dominate the retail digital payments landscape, accounting for 90 percent of the total transaction volume over the next five years.

What do numbers tell?

In May, UPI transactions already experienced remarkable growth, with a value of Rs 14.3 trillion and a volume of 9.41 billion. The transaction volume witnessed 58 percent increase compared to the same period in the previous financial year, while the transaction value rose by 37 percent.

The numbers for May are a significant uptick from April when the platform recorded 8.89 billion transactions.

In June, already in the first 10 days, India has crossed 3.2 billion transactions and it is expected that the country could be at the doorstep of 10 billion transactions in June, a News18 report also confirmed it.

If we look at yearly numbers, 45 billion UPI transactions were registered in FY 21-22, showing 8 times growth in the last 3 years and 50 times growth in the last 4 years, according to Press Information Bureau (PIB).

The month-wise data for the UPI transactions registered during the last year i.e 2022 is as under:

Month UPI Transactions Volume (In crore) Jan-22 461.715 Feb-22 452.749 Mar-22 540.565 Apr-22 558.305 May-22 595.52 Jun-22 586.275 Jul-22 628.84 Aug-22 657.963 Sep-22 678.08 Oct-22 730.542 Nov-22 730.945 Dec-22 782.949 Source-NPCI

The rise of UPI

UPI was introduced by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016 as an interface that allows users to connect multiple bank accounts to a single mobile application and instantly transfer funds. This system ensures safe and convenient money transfers between bank accounts and operates under the strict supervision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and NPCI.

It soon gained widespread acceptance among the masses as the most popular digital payment method. PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, and Cred account for over 95 percent of the market share. Among the various sectors, online retail leads the way, followed by food delivery and mobility (represents cab and

bike aggregators), according to a report by Redseer Strategy Consultants.

The report further projects that 85 percent of businesses in India will be digitally enabled by FY26. This means that a large majority of businesses in India will have embraced digital technologies and processes for their operations, whereas UPI will have a majority share.

According to Satyajeet Kunjeer, Founder and CEO at Deciml, this widespread adoption of UPI in not just tier 1 cities but also tier 2 and 3 cities in just a matter of 7 years, coupled with the demand for UPI in other countries is a testament to it being one of the most advanced payment systems today.

""What’s equally interesting and important to note is that alongside making the ecosystem of transacting simpler and more convenient, UPI is also enabling multiple associated financial services such as expense tracking, budgeting, saving, investing and more,"" he told CNBC-TV18.com.

Anup Nayar, CEO-Domestic, In-Solutions Global believes that government initiatives like Digital India and the push towards a digital economy are the main reasons behind UPI's growth.

UPI helps businesses scale

The Redseer report, mentioned earlier, highlights these:

Low merchant discount rate (MDR): More than 50 percent of UPI transactions are person-to-merchant (P2M), which allows businesses to increase their profit margins compared to card transactions that charge 1.5-2 percent as transaction fees. P2M transactions have shown high growth and low MDR, making them an attractive business option.

Ease in overseas expansion: In October 2022, NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) partnered with Bhutan, Singapore, Malaysia, and other countries. This collaboration aims to assist businesses in expanding their consumer reach and increasing their revenue streams from international markets.

Ease in credit card transactions: Linking credit cards with UPI can boost sales as customers can easily purchase products and services on credit without the inconvenience of carrying physical cards.

Wider customer reach: Integrating UPI with feature phones can assist businesses in reaching customers across various city tiers.

Seamless payment experience with UPI Lite: Eliminating the need for customers to enter their PIN for every UPI payment can increase the frequency of small-ticket transactions (up to Rs 200) thereby leading to an increase in revenue generation through UPI."

This is in line with the recent integration of India’s Unified Payment Interface (UPI) and Singapore’s PayNow payment system.

Last month, UPI and its equivalent network in Singapore, PayNow, were integrated to enable faster remittances between the citizens of the two countries at a highly competitive rate.

“It (UPI-PayNow linkage) is a good example. We have interest in it but we haven’t got to the stage of saying it would be done yet. But initial discussions have happened. I think we would be very interested in benefiting from the similar technology,” Bahrain’s Minister of Industry and Commerce Abdulla Adel Fakhro told The Indian Express.

Fakhro said during the discussion Indian government officials were very open to sharing their experience on the technology. QR code-based merchant payments through UPI apps are already enabled in Bhutan, Singapore and UAE.

Bahrain Economic Development Chief Executive Khalid Humaidan said financial services is an important sector for Bahrain and the country has identified opportunities in the financial services that it wants to focus on over the next few years.

“In our priority list, fintech is at the top. In the world of fintech, payment is very-very important. So, there are multiple conversations with multiple entities in the private and public sectors happening,” Humaidan said.

Fakhro, along with an over 60-member delegation, visited India last week to further increase cooperation and promote investments between the two countries.

“The purpose of the visit is to build and strengthen the relationship between Bahrain and India. Economically, socially and culturally we always had a very strong partnership,” Fakhro said.

In 2022, the bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $1.6 billion, including oil. The non-oil trade was $1.4 billion during the year.

“Hopefully in the next two-three years, I see it (India-Bahrain trades) going up to $2 billion,” Fakhro said.

From an investment perspective, Bahrain is looking at investments in all sectors but particularly in industries related to food, manufacturing, information and communications technology (ICT), downstream aluminium, petrochemicals, research and development, Fakhro said. There’s no income tax or corporate tax in Bahrain.

As of the third quarter of 2022, inward foreign direct investment (FDI) stocks of India to Bahrain reached $1.4 billion, accounting for around 4 per cent of Bahrain’s total FDI stock of $33.9 billion.

The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) organised an interaction on accessing MENA opportunities via Bahrain in partnership with Bahrain’s Ministry of Industry and Commerce and its investment promotion agency Bahrain Economic Development Board."

Scanning to pay remains the most popular way of making digital payments. But have you tried tap to pay? (iStockphoto)

India’s digital payment infrastructure was under the spotlight earlier this week, for all the good reasons. On 20 August, the German embassy in India posted a video on X (formerly Twitter) of Germany’s federal minister for digital affairs and transport, Volker Wissing, using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to make a payment at a vegetable stall in Delhi. The embassy described Wissing’s experience of using UPI payments as “fascinating”.

While seamless payments by simply scanning a QR code and entering a PIN aren’t entirely fascinating to us any more, it is true that India has seen a revolution in digital payments since 2016. This is largely owing to UPI, which facilitates inter-bank peer-to-peer (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M) transactions. It has been developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a not-for-profit owned by a consortium of major banks and promoted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), set up in 2008. Yes, unlike the general perception of it, UPI isn’t a “government service”.

UPI is considered one of the most successful payment systems in the world, in terms of the number of users, volume of transactions and number of transactions. In 2022, UPI enabled over 2,348 transactions every second. In July, there were a whopping 9.96 billion UPI transactions, with a value of ₹15.34 trillion, according to the NPCI.

Scanning to pay remains the most popular way of making digital payments as many people still haven’t tried the other ways one can pay via smartphones and/or the UPI apps. Here are some of the other ways to make digital payments.

Tap-to-Pay

What’s better than scan-to-pay? Tap-to-pay. NFC (near-field communication technology) payments are one of the most widely used payment methods outside India, though digital payments here have been driven by QR codes. That was also because most budget smartphones in India do not pack in NFC chips to cut costs, unlike the Western markets where most phones support NFC.

Now popular UPI apps like Google Pay and Paytm have enabled support for contactless NFC payments. The NFC chip on smartphones works like the chips found on credit and debit cards that support contactless payments. It saves one the hassle of turning on the phone, firing up the UPI app and scanning the QR code.

All you need to do is to tap the back of your smartphone on the payment terminal, or PoS. The transaction will be done automatically if the amount is less than ₹5,000. However, if the amount is more than ₹5,000, you will need to enter the PIN on your smartphone.

At the moment, only select Visa and Mastercard cards issued by certain banks are supported. Also, even though several premium smartwatches support tap-to-pay, you can’t make NFC payments via them in India since the UPI apps do not support those smartwatch platforms (although the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 series launched this month does support tap-to-pay in India via Samsung Wallet).

UPI Lite

India’s tryst with digital payments began with mobile wallets. Paytm, Mobikwik, Freecharge and others were the first digital payment apps most of us used to make small-value transactions at merchants or to transfer money to friends and family.

Even now, some people use the digital wallet feature offered on UPI apps for quick transactions without the UPI PIN. UPI Lite, which takes forward that concept, is an on-device prepaid wallet where you don’t have to enter the PIN.

Most of the popular UPI apps like Google Pay, PhonePe and Paytm support UPI Lite. You just need to enable the feature and choose the primary bank account that will fund the wallet. UPI Lite works exactly like UPI and can be used to transfer money via UPI ID or phone number as well as make transactions via a QR code.

This wallet can be used for any UPI transaction with a value of less than ₹200 (the RBI has recently proposed raising the transaction limit to ₹500). The maximum balance you can keep in your UPI Lite wallet is ₹2,000, to contain the risks associated with the relaxation of two-factor authentication.

One of India’s success story is digital infrastructure. UPI enables everybody to make transactions in seconds. Millions of Indians use it. Federal Minister for Digital and Transport @Wissing was able to experience the simplicity of UPI payments first hand and is very fascinated! pic.twitter.com/I57P8snF0C — German Embassy India (@GermanyinIndia) August 20, 2023

RuPay

RuPay (a portmanteau of rupee and payment), a financial services and payments system conceived by the NPCI, facilitates electronic payment at all Indian banks and financial institutions.

Like Visa and Mastercard, several banks issue RuPay credit and debit cards to customers. You can link the RuPay credit cards to UPI apps and use the card for seamless UPI payments. Earlier, UPI payments were limited to bank accounts; with this new feature, RuPay credit cards can be used via UPI. Since the NPCI wants to push usage of RuPay, the feature isn’t available for credit cards issued by Visa and Mastercard.

While this offers the convenience of digital transactions without a physical card and at merchants which do not otherwise accept credit cards, it also gives people the option of using the credit facility while making UPI transactions instead of using funds from one’s bank account.

Tap-to-pay without UPI apps

While tap-to-pay transactions are limited to UPI apps, there’s a way to use credit or debit cards for payments without one as well. It’s not official, though.

Google Wallet is a mobile payments app that allows users to make payments both online and at physical stores. The app is not available in India (and you will have to sideload it using APK files) since Google offers Google Pay for the Indian market.

You can use Google Wallet, at your own discretion, to bypass UPI registration processes and set up Tap-to-Pay directly for your credit cards.

This works for any Android smartphone that supports NFC. That said, if you use, say, a Samsung smartphone, you could give this a skip since Samsung Pay offers similar functionality.

Digital Rupee

What’s next? Digital Rupee (e ₹), a tokenised digital version of the rupee, issued by the RBI. It’s essentially an electronic form of paper currency, not cryptocurrency. It’s virtual money regulated as legal tender, with no volatility. Its value remains the same, just like the value of physical cash. Like cash, you can transfer this digital money to family and friends and use it for merchant transactions using QR. Digital Rupee was launched last December and several public sector and private banks are participating in the pilot project.

The central bank has made changes to its Master Directions on Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) accordingly. Dr Bhagwat Kisanrao Karad, Union Minister of State for Finance, explained the details in reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on July 31.

UPI for foreign nationals, NRIs visiting India

The UPI facility has been extended to travellers from G-20 countries at the Mumbai, Bengaluru, Mumbai and New Delhi international airports for merchant payments. Later, it will be extended across all entry points in India.

The RBI has made a provision to provide UPI access to NRIs who have international mobile numbers linked to their non-resident ordinary (NRO) or non-resident external (NRE) accounts. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the agency that manages the UPI system, has stated that the facility is available for 10 regions- Australia, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Qatar, Oman, United States, the UAE and the United Kingdom. Earlier, the facility was available only to foreign travellers or NRIs who had Indian mobile numbers.

How foreign nationals, NRIs can use UPI

The users should link their mobile number with an NRO/NRE account. The member bank whose account will be linked by the customer must keep in mind that the required Know Your Customer process (KYC) is done as per Indian laws, including the Foreign Exchange Management (FEMA) Act.

The Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) guidelines by the RBI state that the PPIs can be issued in co-branding arrangement with entities/institutions which are authorised to deal in foreign exchange under FEMA. The PPIs can be used for merchant transactions only. Loading or reloading of such payment instruments will be against receipt of foreign exchange by any payment instrument or cash. The unutilised balances can be transferred “back to source” or encashed in foreign currency.

What the RBI has said on UPI transactions

The Reserve Bank of India has allowed UPI transactions for travellers from G20 countries. The G20 or Group of 20 comprises Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Canada, Germany, China, France, India, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Italy, the US, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the UK, South Africa, Turkey, and the European Union (EU). The move to enable UPI transactions for G20 tourists has been taken during India’s presidency in the group.

Volume of UPI transactions over the years

UPI transactions in India have seen an exponential rise in value, from 5.86 lakh crore in 2018 to 125.94 lakh crore in 2022. From January to June 2023, the value of the transactions was Rs 83.20 lakh crore. Other countries have started accepting UPI payments since last year."

MUMBAI, June 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - India is shaping its digital payments system into a credit engine. It wants banks to offer small loans through the channel residents use to transfer money via their mobile phones. But while the latest official effort to accelerate financial inclusion is gaining traction and will finally allow banks to monetise the homegrown system, it will test the safe limits of growing lending fast.

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is used by 300 million Indians and facilitates 9 billion consumer transactions worth $180 billion per month. Instead of using cash or swiping a debit card to buy vegetables, a Starbucks coffee or an airline ticket, Indians use UPI apps powered by Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Walmart’s (WMT.N) PhonePe at zero cost.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

UPI is an obvious rail to transmit credit. Its users are mostly smartphone owners, and therefore aspirational. Yet barely half of them have active loans and only up to 10% have a credit card. That’s why the regulator is allowing the use of RuPay credit cards, the country’s low-cost answer to Mastercard (MA.N) and Visa (V.N), for UPI payments. Merchants don’t pay a fee on RuPay card transactions worth less than 2000 rupees ($24.40), and fees are capped at 2%, rather than up to 3% global card operators charge.

The one-year-old initiative is now gaining traction. At least seven banks including HDFC Bank (HDBK.NS), Axis Bank (AXBK.NS), Kotak Mahindra Bank (KTKM.NS) and Punjab National Bank (PNBK.NS) have gone live with the feature. In April the regulator went further, enabling banks to offer pre-approved overdraft accounts via UPI.

It’s a fillip to RuPay, which accounts for a quarter of all new credit cards issued, though Visa and Mastercard will remain more popular with higher spenders who want plastic that works seamlessly overseas. One97 Communications' (PAYT.NS) Paytm will also benefit as its network of merchants means it is the largest recipient bank for UPI payments.

Pushing credit on UPI will allow merchants to save on the cost of owning a point of sales terminal. And it adheres to the Reserve Bank of India’s preference for consumer loans to sit within banks, rather than with third-party applications; the regulator’s crackdown last year on prepaid credit facilities issued by wallet providers hurt Tiger Global-backed Slice and Accel-backed Uni.

Yet, the blistering pace of growth in unsecured loans raises concerns. Credit card receivables and lending for purchases of appliances both grew around 30% year on year in April – nearly twice the rate of overall bank loan growth. Delinquencies in unsecured loans were higher in December 2022 than before the pandemic, per TransUnion Cibil.

Fast growth in the financial industry may be a natural byproduct of deepening credit uptake in a quickly expanding economy, as analysts at Bernstein point out. But the regulator is both seeking to support official goals of democratising credit while also warning lenders against “over-aggressive growth”. It muddies both worthy messages.

CONTEXT NEWS

The Reserve Bank of India on April 6 announced a plan to let banks offer pre-sanctioned credit lines to consumers through the country’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI), its homegrown real-time digital payments channel.

Earlier, in June 2022, the central bank had allowed lenders to link RuPay credit cards to UPI accounts. HDFC Bank became the first private bank to go live on UPI with RuPay credit cards in February. Paytm tied up with SBI Cards and Payment Services in May to issue RuPay credit cards to its consumers via UPI, offering cashbacks on small-value payments.

The central bank is looking to tighten scrutiny on unsecured lending portfolios of banks amid a growing risk of potential defaults, Reuters reported on June 13, citing four unnamed sources from the banking industry.

What is interoperability: Interoperability allows users to pay or send money using any UPI app of their choice regardless of who provides the QR code or UPI service for the merchant or receiver. Why does this matter: Currently, some UPI apps and payment providers brand their respective offerings in a way that appears to suggest compatibility with just their own app. This misleads customers into thinking that they will need that particular app to make a payment. For example, a customer might believe that only the Paytm app can be used to pay at a Paytm QR code because the QR code has the branding of Paytm. UPI QR codes, however, work across UPI apps. The latest guidelines requires UPI apps and merchants to brand their products and services to reflect this. What are UPI apps required to do? UPI apps like Phonepe, Google Pay, and Paytm are required to: Include the text ""Send Money to any UPI app"" or ""Scan any UPI QR"" and display the UPI logo along with the logo of prominent UPI apps on the send money and QR scan screens within the app Include the message in all customer and merchant communications including advertisements What are UPI…

""The UPI offering has been temporarily paused for new user onboarding, only to incorporate feedback received on the onboarding flow. We will start enrolling new users by the end of the month,"" a Zomato spokesperson said.

UPI is a real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).

As per details, the service facilitates the transfer of money directly from the user's phone using a UPI PIN on supporting apps. Some of the top players offering UPI service in the country are Google Pay, Paytm, and PhonePe.

According to the announcement, this is the world’s first real-time payment system linkage to use a scalable cloud-based infrastructure that can accommodate future increases in remittance traffic.

Customers of participating financial institutions in both countries will now be able to send and receive funds between bank accounts or e-wallets using just a mobile phone number, UPI identity, or virtual payment address.

Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi officiated the launch, with MAS managing director Ravi Menon and RBI governor Shaktikanta Das executing live cross-border fund transfers to each other from their respective locations in Singapore and India.

DBS Bank and Liquid Group will offer the service to Singapore customers under a phased approach, where they will progressively increase the number of eligible user groups and transaction limits.

The participating financial institutions have committed to ensuring that the service is cost-efficient and accessible, including for foreign workers and students residing in Singapore and India."

UPI Transactions & RuPay Cards: What’s The Next Milestone for India’s Digital Payments Revolution?

Takers worldwide

Making inroads

(The author is co-founder and managing director of In-Solutions Global Ltd.)

The winds of change are blowing across India’s financial landscape and they are being driven by a powerful digital payments ecosystem .It’s been close to seven years since two high-denomination notes were announced as illegal tender. The government’s objective was to promote digital payments and curb the inflow of black money. What followed has been well-documented. But, was the intention achieved?Apparently, yes. Going by a recent report, about 1,050 crore retail digital payment transactions, worth Rs 51-lakh crore, were processed in January 2023 alone.A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) states that the unified payments interface ( UPI ), which is driving the digital payments revolution, accounted for about 75 per cent of the total transaction volume in the retail segment during 2022-23. It is projected to account for 90 per cent of the total transaction volume in retail digital payments over the next five years, the report added.If one were to closely look at it, the entire demonetisation episode could be seen in the pretext of the government launching a Digital India campaign in 2015. One of the objectives of the programme was to achieve a ’faceless, paperless and cashless’ status for financial transactions at the grass-root level.A major boost for the digital payments system came during the Covid-19 outbreak. While the pandemic was causing the destruction of livelihoods and paralyzing the financial structure, digital payments came in handy to almost everyone. From kirana stores to retail giants; from tea stall vendors to autorickshaw drivers and mass ticketing systems; from buying a lego brick to registering property — everything was done in seconds, thanks to multiple payment platforms available in the industry.The Indian-origin Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and the overall system have been so highly developed that lately it is tied up with Singapore’s PayNow, thereby bringing into effect faster and cheaper cross-border transactions through mobile applications. More recently, Japan’s digital minister, Kono Taro, said the country is considering joining the UPI bandwagon to enable cross-border transactions.Apparently, this idea developed following the minister’s visit to one of the tea stalls in New Delhi, and him being pleasantly surprised to find that people were scanning QR codes to make online payments. With the growing mobile phone user population and the availability of cheap internet, the anytime anywhere banking concept has taken its literal meaning.This proved to be a major boost to rural consumption and the ripple effects could be seen in the profit figures of FMCG companies. In other words, money moved from the cities to the villages, and so did the UPI. Banks were one of the other major beneficiaries of this shift.While digital payments continued to make inroads in India, a whole new set of start-ups called fintechs emerged. With technology at the fingertips, banking no longer meant Monday to Friday 9 am to 5 pm. Or, it no longer meant visiting a branch, filling up loan application forms and waiting for a personal interview. You could get instant loans in under two minutes. Some bankers were quick enough to realize the emerging competition and tied up with the fintechs or launched their own versions of it.So, it wasn’t a surprise when RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das recently said the payments landscape in India has evolved into a state-of-the-art system that is affordable, accessible, convenient, fast, safe, and secure. The country has sure, come a long long way from a cash-based economy to a leader in digital payments and financial inclusion."

With its user-friendly interface and robust security features, UPI has become the preferred mode of payment for millions of Indians, making it one of the fastest growing payment systems in the world.

In a recent development, India and Singapore linked their digital payments systems, UPI and PayNow, to enable instant and low-cost fund transfers in a significant push to disrupt the cross-border flow of money between the two nations that amounts to more than $1 billion each year. However, the emerging cases of bank account freezing of some Kerala merchants after receiving UPI payments signify a threat to the model’s existence.

Reportedly, there are at least seven cases of bank account freezing in Kerala. A leading Kerala media house reported the case of Ismail Ibrahim Kutty, who runs a restaurant business in Alappuzha. He received ₹300 from a person through UPI, post which his account got frozen. When enquired, he learned that there was a cyber-case involving the sender’s bank account in Gujarat. Due to this, Ibrahim Kutty cannot withdraw his life earnings from the bank account.

When a person ‘A’ indulges in cyber financial crime and transfers that money from his account to person ‘B’ and ‘C’, the cyber police direct banks to freeze the account of person ‘B’ and ‘C’ on the assumption that the person ‘A’ must have safely transferred that money to other accounts of his or to other partners in crime. However, it may be possible that ‘A’ used the funds to purchase goods and services from different merchants, such as ‘B’ or ‘C’, who are selling that by following the rule of the land, but unaware of the financial scam carried out by ‘A’.

What is the justification of freezing the bank accounts of such innocent merchants who are not even accused in the case, and without carrying out a proper investigation? It is also difficult for an ordinary man to get in touch with the legal department of a different State to get justice. In many cases, cyber police ask third parties (person B or C in this case) to return the money the complainant lost. This action is contrary to all canons of law.

In a similar incident last year, PhonePe Director’s personal bank account was debited to the extent of the amount lost by the complainant in an online scam. While hearing the plea submitted by PhonePe and its Director, the High Court of Karnataka stated that an intermediary could not be held responsible for the financial fraud committed by someone else under the Information Technology Act. It instructed the police to refund the money to the PhonePe Director and trace the alleged fraudster instead. The court had issued a directive to all the magisterial courts in the State to refrain from ordering the seizure of bank accounts of persons not identified as accused of cyber fraud and cybercrime.

The RBI must step in, not just to give justice to the affected bank account-holders but also to instill faith in the UPI system. Otherwise, the chances of merchants refraining from UPI transactions could rise in the future, dampening the digital payments push of the Government.

A top government official told News18 that “35-40 countries” are now considering adopting UPI with India being actively engaged with them on the issue.

Japan was the latest to say earlier this month that it was considering to join the UPI system. “Japanese Digital Minister Kona Taro was in India recently and had met some senior ministers who advised him to check out the usage of UPI in India for himself. The minister went to a coffee shop in Khan Market, Delhi and was amazed to find everyone scanning QR codes there to make online payments. Upon his return to Japan, the minister immediately called for a high-level meeting to discuss the UPI issue,” a top government official told News18.

Other countries who have evinced interest in the UPI digital payments system include Bhutan, Malaysia, UAE, Nepal, France, UK, Russia, Oman, Qatar, Australia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, South Korea and Bahrain among others.

India clocked a record 71,564 million UPI transactions in 2022-23 and has crossed 15,000 million UPI transactions in this fiscal already. The month of April saw the highest-ever number of 8,863 million UPI transactions worth Rs 14,15, 504 crore, as per the records.

The number are only expected to rise further once UPI is accepted at merchant locations abroad for the ease of Indian visitors and expatriates."

Personal loan app CASHe on Thursday released the Financial Mood of the Millennials 2022-23 report, an exclusive and proprietary analysis based on a pool of 540,000 customers. The report reveals that 36 percent of the respondents chose e-NACH and about 27 percent picked UPI for their loan repayment. It also shows that 2022- 23 saw an uptick of one percent in women borrowers compared to previous years.

“One of the top findings of the report is that 84 percent of its customers prefer to take a credit line over personal loans (14 percent) and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL). Satchetised (short-term, small ticket-size) loans of less than Rs 10,000 are preferred by 49 percent of millennials. The data further indicates a significant credit demand from bureau-based prime (44 percent) and near-prime (38 percent) millennials, thereby reinforcing the need for unsecured and hassle-free digital credit products that are easily accessible by all,” CASHe said in a statement.

According to the report, unforeseen medical and monthly expenses are the top two reasons for availing short-term digital credit followed by shopping, home renovation, education, etc. Bangalore seems to lead all the cities in India for credit demand followed by Hyderabad, Pune, Ghaziabad, and Gurgaon.

The data also throws up a surprising insight — West Bengal, Punjab, Gujarat, Assam, and Kerala represent the states from where millennials with the highest bureau scores have availed credit from CASHe.

The report also stated that 68 percent of millennials seek assistance from financial advisors for making investment decisions. Another 45 percent trust social media as a prime source to make investment decisions.

As per the report, about 37 percent of millennials are still somewhat financially dependent on their parents, but a majority of 63 percent of millennials are financially independent. Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) has emerged as the most popular option for online investors, accounting for 35 percent of their investing activities, interest in digital gold (18 percent) is beginning to catch up, followed by tax-saving products (15 percent), goal-based investments (10 percent), real-estate and fixed deposits."

She was speaking at the ' Making Finance Work for Women ' Summit in Mumbai.On a panel discussion deliberating on the need to move from digital financial literacy to digital and financial capability, Deo mentioned how taking a course helps literacy, but it is the usage of the products that help build capability.“We are working with Women’s World Banking to understand what could encourage more women to make digital payments in India, and what it takes for women to come to payments apps,"" she said.UPI allows peer-to-peer and consumer-to-merchant transactions through mobile apps and e-commerce platforms. It registers over 2 billion transactions a month and has been one of the major drivers of the digital payments system in the retail payments space, the Inclusive Finance India Report from 2022 found. The report also stated that women are less savvy in undertaking digital transactions than men.Deo also highlighted that having someone trusted to take a woman customer through the initial steps of getting onboarded and carrying out the first transaction greatly helps them overcome the barrier associated with digital payments. “If women are offered this initial support, the rest of the journey becomes easier,” she said.The panel hosted at the Summit by Women’s World Banking, a nonprofit organization that devises women-centric and commercially-viable financial solutions for banks, FSPs, FIs, and Fintech, said that “classroom-based” digital financial training programmes are not very effective, adding that “learning by doing” is the best way for women to develop confidence and digital capability.“Women need a little extra attention in overcoming sociocultural and mental barriers that exist in their use of digital banking and financial services. Through our work, we help banks and FSPs realize the commercial value that women customers offer as intuitive savers, prudent borrowers, and loyal customers,” Kalpana Ajayan, Regional Head-South Asia, Women’s World Banking said."

The QR codes of e-Re retail and UPI (unified payments interface) may become interoperable in a few weeks from now. That means merchants can receive payments made through e-Re retail using the QR code already available for UPI. They do not have to procure a separate QR code which is currently the practice for e-Re transactions.

This is something which the National Payments Council of India (NPCI) and the Reserve Bank of India are closely working on.

Also read: e-Re and you: What you should know

According to highly placed sources, in a few weeks formally the interoperability of e-Re and UPI QRs will be implemented. To begin with such an interoperability will be implemented only at the front-end, that is at the point at which payment is received. At the back-end e-Re will follow a separate process and UPI will continue to operate in the current way that it is in place. To put things in context, e-Re operates on a bank wallet mechanism whereas UPI is directly linked to the users’ bank accounts.

At the back end even if interoperability comes into place, a payment made through UPI will be credited to the receiver’s UPI account, and a payment made through e-Re will go into the wallet of the receiver. At the back-end, both payment mechanisms will function like independent entities.

Why interoperability?

This upgrade to e-Re is critical to increase the merchant adoption for digital currencies. “Banks are trying to popularise and spread the adoption of e-Re among merchants because unless more merchants sign up and the use case for e-Re increases the adoption will remain poor” said a banker aware of the matter. The merchants adoption rate for UPI is healthy and steadily increasing and they already have QR stickers of various UPI gateways. “We found that there is a resistance from them to pile on another QR sticker and hence the decision to make UPI and e-Re QR codes interoperable”.

According to the latest published annual reports of the RBI, the total e-Re adoption in the country is it just about ₹16.39 crore. Of this, the contribution of retail digital currency was less than ₹6 crore."

Importance of platform-specific UPI payment solutions

Indian fintech startup, Razorpay has launched a new product called Turbo UPI. For this product, Razorpay has partnered with Axis Bank and the National Payments Council of India ( NPCI ). Turbo UPI claims to make UPI payments faster and reduce potential payment failures. The company will also allow merchants to integrate Turbo UPI at the payment gateway. This will eliminate the need for customers to go to third-party UPI payment apps and they can pay directly from their UPI-linked bank accounts within the merchant app.Razorpay also claims that this product will also help businesses to achieve nearly a 10% increase in the success rate of UPI payments. Turbo UPI also promises a 2-step UPI payment experience for end-users. This also claims to make the payment experience 5X faster.Turbo UPI is still in the pilot stage. However, some popular apps including Tata StarQuik, Ixigo, FNP (Ferns N Petals), Trainman and Dhan are among the multiple companies that are soon going to enable this product on their platforms.Using third-party apps like Google Pay or PhonePe can make the payment process inconvenient due to the additional steps involved. At times, customers can also miss payments if messages or notifications for the payment prompt get delayed.This is why major digital merchants prefer to build their own UPI payment solutions. For example, Amazon has Amazon Pay UPI, whileZomato recently launched Zomato UPI . Reports suggest that Walmart-owned Flipkart is also planning to start its own UPI payments solution."
Cross-Border Payments in FinTech - TechFunnel,Cross-Border Payments in FinTech  TechFunnel,"Mon, 07 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://consent.google.com/m?continue=https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hmdW5uZWwuY29tL2ZpbnRlY2gvY3Jvc3MtYm9yZGVyLXBheW1lbnRzL9IBAA?oc%3D5&gl=FR&m=0&pc=n&cm=2&hl=en-US&src=1,TechFunnel,https://www.techfunnel.com,"In recent years, domestic payments have experienced a complete transformation, and overseas transactions have started to follow suit.

Historically, cross-border payments faced a number of barriers, including lengthy and uncertain transfer times, a dearth of cost transparency, and exorbitant transfer and conversion rates. Before reaching their destination, payments had to go through numerous institutions, leading to delays and incurring fees.

To control liquidity, react to customer queries, and examine anomalies, financial institutions were forced to allocate a significant portion of staff and assets. This is where fintech can offer innovative, customer-centric offerings in the cross-border payments sector.

Why is Cross-Border Payment an Important Fintech Use Case?

Fintechs are turning their focus to the cross-border payments sector for several reasons:

1. Banks are typically slow in processing cross-border transactions, opening a new market opportunity for fintech

The typical processing time for a cross-border money transfer is between two and five days, which is tardy when compared to nearly instantaneous domestic transfers. Depending on the payer’s and payee’s institutions, the transfer of funds from one country to another may pass through multiple intermediaries in various third-party nations.

A lack of standardization and automation in banking networks and payment systems is a contributor to these lengthy processing times. If institutions on both ends are not participants of a cross-border payment system, like CHIPS (Clearing House Interbank Payments System), the path of an international transfer can seem to be extremely convoluted.

For instance, imagine a US-based company transfers funds to a South Korean firm via a non-CHIPS member bank. The bank must request another bank to transfer funds via CHIPS to an authorized correspondent bank in the United States.

Consequently, several cross-border remittances need several days to process, giving fintech a clear opportunity to step in and differentiate themselves.

2. Traditional cross-border payments can be costly and cut into international business transactions

Due to a wide range of factors, international transaction fees may get quite expensive. However, the primary reason is the same as for slow transaction speed: an elevated number of intermediaries associated with a money transfer. Each and every associate bank charges for its services.

Other considerations encompass regulatory and compliance fees and currency conversion costs. Since the overall cost of a transaction is an important factor for both organizations and consumers when selecting a provider of payment services, banking institutions that don’t offer affordable rates risk losing customers to competitors.

This is an incredible opportunity for fintech since they are well-positioned to offer a cost advantage to their users.

3. Banks cannot provide modern customers with the transparency and visibility they have come to expect in the digital era

Frequently, the payer and payee can’t track the status of an international payment online. An abundance of intermediaries and a lack of standardization makes it increasingly difficult to reach the right entity in the event of a payment halt or investigation. This is accompanied by a lack of transparency surrounding all fees and deductions.

Almost every business that engages in international payments has, at least once, encountered unanticipated fees that dramatically rise (or drop) during the course of an international payment. Such unpredictability isn’t beneficial for company performance and has an immediate impact on profits.

The inability to track the transactions has a negative impact on cash flow and the health of the organization, especially in the case of small to mid-sized businesses. Fintechs that can offer these features can gain a significant market advantage over its larger, less-digitally-enabled competitors.

4. Regulatory compliance around cross-border payments is a complex and evolving space

The financial sector is among the most strictly regulated by authorities globally. For instance, payment service providers in the United States must adhere to the following regulations: Know Your Customer (KYC), Basel III, The Patriot Act, Sarbanes-Oxley, Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), and PCI DSS.

Given that cross-border payments have to conform to rules established by both the creditor and the recipient’s nation-states, the challenges are compounded: banks have to constantly track changes in regulation in each country to which they send funds and alter their policies accordingly. Consequently, several organizations decide either to not offer remittances abroad at all or to severely restrict them.

Fintechs, on the other hand, have the data capabilities needed for stringent regulatory compliance and easier audits. They are well-positioned to demonstrate compliance through auto-generated reported and digitally assisted workflows.

5. Cultural expectations differ across countries, and traditional banks have been slow to adapt

People and cultural concerns additionally create challenges for international remittances. The customer experience varies from country to country; for instance, face-to-face interactions may be considered essential in one region but not as much in another.

Therefore, operators functioning in this sector must take into account the cultural differences of the nations in which they operate and offer solutions accordingly. Numerous fintechs have attempted to improve their consumer experience by providing products and services in various languages and expanding their draw in multilingual countries.

This is something that banks have struggled with, due to their long legacies of operation and entrenched operational culture that’s almost always wedded to a specific region or country.

How Can Fintechs Transform Cross-Border Payments?

Fintechs leverage technology to create low-cost international payment solutions for people, startups, and larger enterprises. They can revolutionize the cross-border payments system with improved customer service, worldwide coverage, adaptable and responsive payment options, reduced transaction fees, and shorter transaction timeframes.

Transfers can be managed by fintech firms using two primary models:

Cross-border payment tracks work independently of traditional financial networks

Technology solutions that enable customers’ access to legacy bank lines

In the second case, a fintech corporation has a global network of accounts. It maintains local currency balances with a treasury division in charge of managing these local accounts.

The consumer starts a transaction in the local currency at the neighborhood fintech office. The details of the transaction are transmitted to the financial institution in country B, which sends the agreed-upon quantity of funds in the currency of the country to the domestic account of the beneficiary.

Essentially, each international transaction consists of two domestic transactions. Multiple times per month, accounts and offices are settled to optimize the exchange rate. The transfer fees range between 0.25 and 1% of the transaction amount, based on the destination.

A second method is to set up faster payment channels. The user’s account or registered identity, like the Unified Payment Interface (UPI), will be used to finance the transactions. These apply proxy identifiers like cell phone numbers to expedite cross-border payments using new channels.

Some fintechs are trying out distributed ledger technology (DLT) for international remittances. Before transferring funds, this model verifies transactions with DLT (i.e., the blockchain network). This model has gained success with clients who send smaller sums of money, notably small- and medium-sized enterprises.

Action Points for Fintech Companies

To capitalize on this opportunity, financial technology or fintech companies need to:

Build unified experiences with a connected user experience : Regardless of the variety of correspondent banks or other parties involved in the value chain of custody, fintech must prioritize convergence. Organizations that can offer their customers a unified payment experience will enjoy a competitive advantage.

This will help validate transaction data swiftly, make decisions more easily, and use the information to manage the compliance burden. Offer real-time FX rates and smart routing: Offering transparent real-time rates will aid fintech companies in gaining consumer trust and distinguishing themselves from traditional financial organizations. They must also reduce the number of payment pathway touchpoints to minimize intermediary fees.

In the future, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can play an important role in the growth of fintech in the cross-border solution space.

Traditional payment networks are not highly interconnected. Due to the disparities in laws, regulations, and processes across various legislations, cross-border remittances are plagued with challenges. CBDCs can address this issue with initial coordination between diverse national CBDC designs.

In partnership with NZIA Ltd. and Zynesis Pte. Ltd., the Central Bank of The Bahamas launched the world’s first CBDC, Sand Dollar, in October 2020. In addition to China, South Korea, and Sweden, 14 other countries have launched exploratory programs.

Interestingly, this is also a big opportunity for fintech companies to work hand in hand with traditional banks and governments to boost cross-border payment capabilities at scale.

Wrapping Up

In 2022, the volume of global international money transfers is projected to exceed $156 trillion. Conventional financial institutions are losing a substantial share of the market to fintech, and several banks are sitting up and taking notice. They have begun constructing new cross-border payment platforms and mobile apps, revaluing FX or transfer costs, and partnering with fintech companies to improve their services.

Overall, the future looks bright for international payment customers, both via fintech competition and competition."

While discussing the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting today, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that steps would be taken to simplify the process of issuance, redemption and a few aspects of the current framework.

This measure will make the benefits of e-RUPI digital voucher accessible to a wider set of users and further deepen the penetration of digital payments in the country, said RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Thursday after announcing the repo rate revision, inflation rate at the bi-monthly monetary policy meeting.

The e-RUPI vouchers are pre-paid digital tools that a beneficiary receives on phone in the form of an SMS or QR code. The e-RUPI, a digital voucher launched in August 2021, rides on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).

Till now, purpose-specific e-RUPI vouchers are issued by 11 banks in partnership with the NPCI. The 11 banks are Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Indian Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India and Union Bank of India.

Watch: RBI MPC meet Outcome: Repo rate unchanged; check inflation, e-RUPI, RuPay cards announcements, and more

“At present, purpose-specific vouchers are issued by banks on behalf of central and state governments and to a limited extent on behalf of corporates. Keeping in view the benefits for users and beneficiaries alike, it is proposed to expand the scope and reach of e-RUPI vouchers by (a) permitting non-bank Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) issuers to issue e-RUPI vouchers and (b) enabling issuance of e-RUPI vouchers on behalf of individuals,” Das said on Thursday.

“Other aspects like reloading of vouchers, authentication process, issuance limits, etc., will also be modified to facilitate use of e-RUPI vouchers. Separate instructions will be issued shortly,” he added.

More about e-RUPI

e-RUPI stands differently from the digital currency that is contemplated by the RBI.

The voucher is in the form of a pre-paid voucher which can be redeemed at the centers that accept it.

It is a one-time contactless, cashless voucher-based mode of payment that can be used by beneficiaries to redeem it without a card, digital payments app, or internet banking access.

The beneficiary need not be required to have a bank account. As it ensures an easy, contactless two-step redemption process that doesn’t need sharing of personal details.

The best part of e-RUPI is it operates on a basic phone without an internet connection, therefore, has a wider reach.

Industry reaction

""The issuance of e-Rupee vouchers on behalf of individuals expands the market potential and increases customer engagement. Additionally, the widespread adoption of e-Rupee vouchers promotes digital transactions, boosting the efficiency and speed of payments, thereby enhancing the overall operational efficiency and financial management for businesses in India,” said Akash Sinha, Co-Founder & CEO, Cashfree Payments.

""Till now, the reach of e-RUPI was limited as it could be issued by banks on behalf of Central and State Governments and a few corporates. However, now with non-bank Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) issuers being permitted to issue e-RUPI vouchers and e-RUPI vouchers being issued on behalf of individuals, the scope and use-cases pertaining to e-RUPI will expand,"" said Mandar Agashe, Founder and MD, Sarvatra Technologies.

""e-RUPI has now been formalised as a prepaid instrument, it will facilitate non-bank PPI issuers, individuals, and corporates to utilise it for various programs. It will make the benefits of the e-RUPI accessible to a wider set of users and further deepen the penetration of digital payments. Picture a token delivered in the form of an entitlement, capable of reimbursing bills or covering medical treatments for end users. We believe that e-RUPI can also ensure the desired end use of donations, whether it is toward medical purposes or other forms of assistance for beneficiaries. We are readily awaiting the directions from the regulator to initiate these programs,"" said Anand Kumar Bajaj, Founder, MD & CEO, PayNearby.

""The expansion of e-RUPI vouchers to include non-bank Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) issuers and the ability to issue vouchers on behalf of individuals significantly increases the accessibility and usability of this indigenous digital currency. We anticipate a wide range of opportunities and benefits arising from this expansion, benefiting both users and beneficiaries. e-RUPI, as a distinctive digital payment solution, enables convenient and accessible transactions without the need for a bank account,"" said Rahul Tandon, Chief Product Officer, Safexpay.

The Indian payments handbook 2022–2027 revealed that UPI 123PAY and UPI Lite are expected to increase the adoption of digital payments in rural areas.

The report added, ""UPI for foreign tourists, UPI linkage to credit accounts and tie-ups with real-time payments systems of other countries will further increase foreign inward remittance.""

The report further stated that India is becoming a credit-friendly market with the introduction of products like credit card linkage to UPI, innovations in credit card products and banks focusing on bringing in new credit card offerings.

Credit cards show promising growth in future, with the transaction volumes expected to grow by three times by FY 2026–-27 due to new players coming up in this space.

Opening up the Indian market to credit has been well balanced by the conservative approach to mitigate elements of credit risk (by closely monitoring market behaviour), offering new products – covering new credit and credit card segments – and also creating awareness about the pros and cons of these products, it added.

According to the report, India has moved ahead of the stage where incentives, cashback and rewards acted as a catalyst to encourage users to transact digitally.

""We have observed that Indian customers are now habituated and more comfortable with digital transactions. This trend is expected to continue and grow in the future,"" it mentioned.

It said that this has been made possible due to the dedicated focus of the government and regulator and the efforts of all operators and stakeholders in the payments ecosystem, who have enabled a safe, convenient and easy-to-use experience for customers."

Over 95,000 cases of UPI fraud transactions were recorded in India in 2022-23, as per the finance ministry data. This marks a sharp rise from 84,000 cases in 2021-22 and 77,000 cases in 2020-21.

There are several ways you can secure your account from UPI fraud. By following these tips you can remain vigilant against scammers.

Tips to protect yourself from UPI fraud

Do not share your UPI PIN/OTP: One big mistake people often make is that they share their UPI PIN or OTP with scammers. Fraudsters often pose as representatives from banks or government agencies to trick people into revealing their financial details. Remember that no bank or government authority will ask for your OTP, PIN or password.

Don’t open random links: You may receive messages from unknown numbers asking you to click on a link to receive a reward or update your Know Your Customer (KYC) details. Clicking on these links will allow scammers to collect your UPI PIN and withdraw money from your account. Do not visit such links from your devices.

Check any payment link: Before making any payment, you should always check the account holder’s name and UPI link. Do not accept a payment link if any unknown account has requested it. This can help you avoid UPI fraud.

Beware of counterfeit apps: Do not download and install any fake payment apps. These apps profess to provide banking or financial services and steal customer data.

Use only secure Wi-Fi connections: Using unsecured, public Wi-Fi connections can leave you vulnerable to hackers. Ensure that you use a secure mobile internet or Wi-Fi connection while making any transactions so that your personal data is safe.

Alert your bank immediately: Keep a regular track of your financial transactions. Alert your bank immediately if you see any suspicious activity. Keep a UPI payment limit for daily transactions so that you can get an alert when any unauthorised payment takes place."
